path that leads to a sub -area called the Ancestral Mound will be 
unlocked. Follow the path with the torches until you reach the top that 
leads to the Ancestral Mound. Here, you'll encounter an NPC called Snail 
Shaman, speak to her and she will provide you with the Vengeful 
Spiritspell - upon consuming it, The Knight will lose consciousn ess and 
you'll be locked in.Once you've awakened, speak to the Snail Shaman who

is anElder Baldur. To defeat it, you'll have to walk up a bit and wait 
for it to stand back up from it's curled position and then attack it 
using the Vengeful Spiritspell. If you stand too close it will curl back 
into a ball making it invulnerable to all of your attacks. It'll take 
about 4 hits from the Vengeful Spirit for it to die. I f you run out of 
SOUL, wait for the Baldur to spit out a smaller enemy, which you can hit 
to regain SOUL.Once you've killed the beast, continue going left where

BasinTo get to the Ancient Basin, retrace your course back to the arena 
of the Dung Defenderat the Royal Waterw ays towards the lever that was 
activated to drain the acid water. From here, you'll want to enter the 
next section to your right then drop all the way to the bottom where 
you'll find a broken lift. Be careful going down since you'll come across 
platforms t hat have spikes, so be sure to use jump onto the platforms one 
at a time and always look down to check your surroundings. Once you've 
reached the bottom part of the room, you can find a Whispering Root tree 
to extract Essence which inside a secret room to your right and the next 
section you'll have to enter to your left - upon entering the next 
section,drop down under the bridge, slide down the pillar and then use 
Crystal Heartto fly across the other end to find 1x Wanderer's 
Journalnext to a corpse of a bu g.Free a Grub, Acquire a Pale OreAfter 
acquiring the Wanderer's Journal, continue heading west by using the 
elevated platforms to get across. Fight your way through the Winged 
Sentry and Lance Sentryuntil you reach the southwest end side of the room 
where you'll find an opening that will take you into the tram station. 
Once you've arrived at the station, continue heading west and then drop 
down into the hole leading into the next section.You'll now encounter a 
new enemy called a Lesser Mawlek, these creatur es are tricky since they 
spit out infected blobs and strike by swinging their legs forward. After 
killing the enemy, drop down into the gap and use Desolate 
Dive/Descending Darkto break the shaking floor below you. There will be 
another Lesser Mawlekguardi ng a trapped Grub. Now, you'll have to acquire 
a Pale Ore.At the far west tunnel of the tram system leading to Deep 
Nest, Cloth can be found by killing all the enemies. She willcome from 
under the ground and thank you.Climb back up after rescuing the grub 
until you reach the top then head west until you come across a path that 
has Infected Balloonsappearing at the background and through the path. 
Follow the path until you reach a small arena where you'll encounter 2x 
Lesser Mawlek, you'll need to kill both of it to proceed further. Once 
that's dealt with, continue heading to your left where you can find 1x 
Pale Orenext to a broken shell.Finding CorniferAfter you've acquired the 
Pale Oreand have freed the Grub, head back to the tram station and drop 
down into  the next section beside the toll machine where you'll 
respectively arrive at the Ancient Basin. As you head down, you'll find a 
room with a fountain to your right. If you drop 3,000 Geo into the 
fountain, you can acquire 1xVessel Fragmentas a reward.You'l l also hear 
Corniferhumming as you head down, and you can find him just below the 
room with the fountain. Once you find him, you can purchase a copy of the 
map for 112 Geo. From here there are two paths that can take you to a 
sub-area and another location.  If you head down southeast from where 
Cornifer is, you can find a path going up that leads to a sub -area called 
the Palace Groundswhich requires the Monarch Wingsability to reach it 
while the southern end can take you to The Abysswhich requires the King's  
Brandkey to unlock the gate. So for now, the only way you can go to is 
southwest of Cornifer's location where you can find a toll machine that 
requires 150 Geo to unlock a bench. Pay the amount and rest on the bench 
to save the game and update your map - when you're done, continue going 
west by using theCrystal Heartability to get across until you reach the 
next section.Acquiring a Simple KeyUpon entering the next section,jump

passage t hat has spikes protruding from the walls. You'll know you're on the right track when you see theLightseedsrun away from you when you 
land. Before you continue to drop down into the next section, go up one 
level to find a cluster of geo that's at the top le ft.When you're in the 
next section, follow the path where you'll encounter another enemy called 
a Mawlurk. These creatures are immobile and can be found either on the 
ground or ceiling continuously spitting out infected blobs upon contact. 
As you encounter  the third Mawlurkthat is on the ceiling above the small 
platforms and spiked pits, cross the path and then drop down the next 
passage where you'll find a large dead creature that looks like a Mawlurk 
- you can go inside its mouth to find a secret room whe re you'll find 
1xSimple Keynext to a corpse of a bug. From there, you'll want to head 
back up and head west where you'll work your way around back to the 
previous section.Once you're back, head west, then climb up to the top 
and continue going west until y ou reach the main boss of this location 
which is the Broken Vessel. You'll know you're on the right path once you 
see infected balloons at the background which indicates you're near the 
arena of the boss. If you go right of the arena, there is a wall that can 
be broken, unlocking a shortcut, making the walk back to the boss much 
easier.Boss Battle, Broken VesselUpon entering the arena, walk bythe 
corpse of the Broken Vesseland the gates will close. The arena will then 
begin to shake and multiple Lifeseedswi ll emerge and rush in to fill the 
broken shell which forms a large bulb protruding out and causing the 
corpse to reanimate in order to attack The Knight. You can click hereto 
learn more about the strategies on how to defeat this boss. Once you've 
defeated the Broken Vessel, the blobs covering the left side of the arena 
will burst, allowing you to enter the path leading to the Monarch Wings. 
Simply follow the path going west until you reach the end where you can 
consume the Monarch Wings ability that allows The Knight to perform a 
double jump.Rescue a GrubOnce you've acquired the ability, head back to 
the entrance by going east until you reach the column that is too high 
for you to reach. You can unlock a shortcut by going east from the Broken 
Vessel's arena and by breaking the wall. With the Monarch Wingsconsumed, 
you can now reach the higher part of the room with the help of the newly 
acquired ability.When you arrive at the top, go west until you reach a 
corner filled with spikes. The Grub can be found at th e top left corner 
of the area, and in order for you to reach it, you'll have to 
simultaneously jump, dash, and cling onto the walls to reach it. After 
rescuing the Grub, you can head back down and retrace your course back to 
the bench.Hidden Stag StationFr om the bench, go east until you reach the 
intersection that can take you to either the Palace Groundsor The Abyss. 
With the Monarch Wingsconsumed, you can now reach the higherpart of the 
section that leads to the Palace Grounds.Upon arriving at the Palace 
Grounds, continue heading east until you reach a dead end. You can break

CocoonsRefill depleted Soul TotemsHow to FindBench in Hollow 
KnightBenches are scattered throughout the game's Locations (se e 
individual location pages for details). On average almost every area you 
visit will have at least two benches.You can purchase a Bench Pin 
fromIselda inDirtmouth. Her shop will be closed until you've spoken to 
her husband Cornifer, beaten False Knight or  progressed into the next 
area after Crossroads. With this pin, once you've sat on a bench, its 
location will be automatically displayed on your map.Some benches can 
only be accessed by paying a toll. Keep a small amount of Geo on your 
person while explori ng new areas in case you find a toll machine.Two 
benches in Hollow Knight are tied to specific conditions: one at Crystal 
Peak, where you will need to defeat a boss to bench, and one in Distant 
Village, where sitting on the bench transports you to Beast's Den.Bench 
Notes & TipsThe appearance of benches varies based on the area you're in! 
Despite this you're unlikely to miss one, as whenever you approach a 
bench, a sign will helpfully prompt you to sit down.The trap bench found 
in Distant Village has the sam e appearance as the one in Colosseum of 
Fools (minus the webbing). This type of bench texture is not used 
anywhere else in the game. While it may be pure coincidence, it could 
also be hinting at the way Colosseum acquires its combatants when there's 
a shortage of volunteers. The Knight never gets trapped in the Colosseum, 
but Zote the Mighty does.   ItemsArcane Egg,City Crest,Delicate

BirthplaceThe Birthplace is an area that  is located deep within The Abyss. Its entrance can be found at the bottom west side of The Abyss and 
can only be accessed if The Knighthas acquired both pieces of the 
Kingsoulcharm to form it into one. The Kingsoulcharm is broken into two 
pieces, half is held by The White Lady, and the other half is with The 
Pale King.Acquiring the Kingsoul CharmYou'll most likely run into The 
White Ladyfirst and you'll acquire the first half of the charm. The White 
Ladyis located in the Queen's Gardenswhere you'll have to  face and defeat 
the Traitor Lordfirst to gain access into her hiding place. To get the 
other half will be quite challenging since you'll need togrind and obtain 
1,800 Essence in order to upgrade the Dream Nailinto the Awoken Dream 
Nail.You'll automaticall y acquire the Dream Nailonce you arrive at the 
Resting Groundsand when you first encounter the Dream World. You'll then 
meet Seerwho is a merchant that will trade items with you in exchange for 
Essence. The only difference with the Seer is that you won't b e able to 
view the inventory but instead, you'll have to collect the required 
number of Essence for each item until theSeerrequests for essence in 
exchange for the Awoken Dream Nail. Gaining Essence is the challenge 
since there are only two ways that you c ancollect essence. First, is by 
challenging the Warrior Dreams, they are scattered around the map but you 
can learn more about their information in their individual pages here. 
Not only can you challenge Warrior Dreams, but you can alsofight some 
bosses th at have their dream variations like Zote the Mighty, the False 
Knight, the Broken Vessel, the Dung Defender, and the Soul Master. You 
can challenge their dream variations by heading to the current location 
or last known location of these bosses and strike them with the Dream 
Nail to enter the dream world. And the second way to acquire essence is 
by looking for Whispering Root trees that are scattered around the map. 
Striking these trees with the Dream Nailwill cause it to burst out a few 
essence that you ca n collect.Once you have enough essence and have 
acquired the Awoken Dream Nail, you'll have to travel to the east side of 
the Ancient Basinwhere you will find the Palace Grounds. There isn't much 
that you can find there, but only a corpse of a Kingsmould. You'll have 
to dream nail the corpse with the Awoken Dream Nailin order to transport 
yourself into the White Palaceinside the dream world. From there, you'll 
have to work your way to the throne room where you'll find the corpse of 
The Pale King - strike his  body multiple times to acquire the second half 
of the Kingsoulcharm. His body will mysteriously vanish afterward.Upon 
combining both pieces, you can now travel back to The Abyssandopen up the 
path leading to The Birhplace. A series of events will then hap pen and at 
the end will result into The Knight absorbing The Void and acquiring the 
Void Heartcharm which is an essential charm that you'll need if you want 
to achieve the Dream No MoreEnding.Video[video goes here]Map[map goes

 Bretta   LocationDirtmouthFungal WastesBretta is an NPC in Hollow 
Knight. Bretta is a lonely beetle and a hopeless romantic.Bretta 
InformationBretta is a lonely young be etle who, after being rescued and 
found at theFungal Wastes by the Knight, will move to her house 
inDirtmouth. Inside her house, players will learn that she has fallen in 
love with the Knight and will also find countless materials depicting the 
Knight, suc h as paintings, dolls, and even romantic diary entries about 
them. However, if players choose to saveZote the Mightytwice and then 
defeat him at theColosseum of Fools, Zote will move to Ditmouth where the 
two will meet. Bretta then grows fond of Zote, chan ging and showing all 
her dedications to Zote instead of the Knight. Bretta imagines Zote to be 
a mighty, invincible warrior, who she dreams up asGrey Prince Zote, which 
the Knight can defeat in her dreams, granting an achievement.Location: 
Bretta Can be fo und at the Fungal Wastes, southeast of Mantis Village, 
past the Dashmaster statue and through difficult parkour.Progression: 
Bretta moves to her house in Dirtmouth, and falls in love with the Knight for saving her. However, after you defeat Zote the Mighty  in the 
Colosseum of Fools, he goes back to Dirtmouth, and Bretta falls in love 
with him. A secret room beneath her house will then become accessible, 
where you can fight a dream battle with her fantasy of Zote, known asGrey 
Prince Zote. When you defeat Gr ey Prince Zote, Bretta loses confidence in 
the real Zote, and eventually she leaves Dirtmouth, never to 
return.Combat: Players may not kill Bretta.Rewards: Finding and speaking 
to her unlocks her house in Dirtmouth and a Mask Shard, in addition to 
what mig ht be her diary.Associated QuestsBretta (Quest): After you find 
and rescue her at the Fungal Wastes, she will head back to Dirtmouth and 
sta in her house. Inside her house, players will find dedications to the 
Knight, as she has grown fond of them after be ing rescued.Related 
NPCs:Zote the Mighty (Grey Prince Zote)Endings impact: None, but her fate 
can be influenced by your actions. Choosing to save and defeat Zote the 
Mighty at the Colosseum of Fools will cause Bretta to show her 
infatuation to Zote instead  of the Knight. This unlocks a basement with a 
statue of Zote in her house. If the Knight hits the statue with the Dream 
Nail and defeats Grey Prince Zote 4 times, Bretta decides to set out on 
her own and leaves Hallownest.DialogueOhhh... please... don't l eave me 
behind!You... forgot about me...?I knew you would... everyone always 
forgets about me...Oh?! Who are you?Your face... you're so... so...I -I'm 
sorry. I got lost, I don't know how I ended up here. I... you came here 
to rescue me, Bretta? The girl tha t everyone just... ignores?Sorry, when 
I look at your face I can hardly... I just can't believe you came all the

LocationsDirtmouthFungal WastesBretta WalkthroughTo start things off, you 
will need to rescue Bretta from succumbing to the infection. She can be 
located in the southern area of Fungal Wastesnear the Royal Waterways. 
The area is quite challenging to traverse, so you will need to acquire 
Mantis Claw andMothwing Cloak to aid you with reaching Bretta's 
location.Once you've reached the platform, similar to Sly, you'll find an 
almost infected Bretta, whose sanity comes back once you speak to her. 
She will thank you and return to her home in Dirtmout h. Bretta's house is the one at the farthest right.Now you'll be able to unlock the inside of 
her house. You will find her sleeping, a Mask Shardas a reward, her diary 
for you to read, and at the background trinkets resembling The Knight, 
which implies tha t she has grown fond of The Knight for rescuing her and 
shows it by making figures and paintings of The Knight.Sometimes she will 
show up on the Dirtmouth bench outside. She will make a little "oh!" 
sound as you approach. You can sit next to her, and she w ill blush. This 
unlocks a new entry in her diary.It may look like the quest has ended, 
but it doesn't stop there.As you continue your journey, you will 
encounter Zote the Mightytwice in Greenpathand Deepnestwho seems to be 
caught up in the middle of danger . You'll encounter him almost being 
eaten and trapped, and you must save him twice before encountering him at 
the Colosseum of Fools. At the Colosseum of Fools, he will be the final 
boss at the Trial of the Warrior - all you have to do is defeat him to 
advance the quest.After the most difficult battle, having defeated Zote 
The Mighty, head back to Dirtmouth where you'll find a mesmerized Bretta 
listening to the ever -mighty Zote. Listen in on the conversation, and you 
will learn Zote has appropriated your vi ctory at the Colosseum.Once 
you're done listeningto the conversation, head back to Bretta's house 
where you'll find all the trinkets created in the image of The Knight 
have now been replaced with portraits and entries of Zote the Mighty. It 
may look like h er obsession stops there. Inspect the middle part of her 
house to head down into the basement where you'll find a reimagined 
statue of Zote, the Grey Prince Zote. At this point, make sure you have 
theDream Nail - as hitting the statue with the Dream Nail tr ansports you 
into the dream world and the boss arena of Grey Prince Zote. Come 
prepared, as he is a very tough boss (unironically this time).To close 
this quest, defeat Grey Prince Zote 4 times. This will cause Bretta to 
leave Dirtmouth. Elderbugmentions t hat Bretta has left town to overcome 
her problem of obsession and worshipping heroes and wishes to discover 
herself. Although he also mentions that she headed into the Howling 
Cliffs, Bretta cannot be found in that area.Bretta Notes & Notable

 Broken Vessel LocationGodhomeAncient BasinHealth525RewardMonarch 
WingsBroken Vessel is a Boss in Hollow Knight. Bosses are special 
Enemiesthat feature their own arena, a large amount of health, and a 
variety of un ique moves and abilities.You will need to perform multiple 
attacks such as using The Nail and Nail Arts along with theSpells and 
Abilitiesin order to defeat them. Some bosses are capable of entering 
into a state of stagger after landing a number of attacks  on them.As soon 
as you encounter a boss,its namewill appear on the screen, the music will 
change into a boss battle theme, and usually, pathsconnecting the arena 
will close or will be blocked leaving you no choice but to face these 
devastating and unique foes.Shattered corpse, reanimated by infected

Hallownest, but not quite the same. Where did these empty little 
wanderers come from? -Hunter's Journal entry on Broken VesselBroken Vessel 
LocationGodhome(Mini -boss)Main Location: Ancient Basin, at the west end of the area.This boss is optional and does not need to be defeated to 
advance the story.Broken Vessel RewardsMonarch WingsBroken Vessel 
StrategiesStrategy WriteupThis boss is aggressive since most of the time 
it will lock onto The Knight, willhave mix -ups with its attacks,and will 
most likely have most of the area spawned with annoying Infected 
Balloons. So the first thi ng to keep in mind is to have the right Charms, 
Spells, and Nail Artsequipped before heading into battle.Charms: First 
you would want to consider having Quick Focusequipped as it will help you 
recover your health quickly while trying to avoid and close in for 
attacks. Second, having a defensive charm such as Thorns of Agony, 
Defender's Crest, or Spore Shroomwill work so that you can inflict damage 
even when taking damage, by running and jumping inside the arena, or by 
using FOCUS. And finally, the Grubsongc harm. Since it is most likely that 
you will take damage from its annoying spawn ability, it would be better 
to have the Grubsong charm equipped so that you can recover SOUL while 
taking damage.Spells and Abilities: Whichever Spell you have acquired 
will help you with inflicting more damage on this boss. Spells like 
Vengeful Spirit or Shade Soulwill definitely work with dealing damage 
from a distance especially if The Broken Vessel will performan attack 
that requires it to channel or concentrate first. Desol ate Diveis also a 
helpful spell where you can inflict damage while avoiding any projectile 
attack it has such as the constant spawn or releasing of Infected 
Balloons. And of course, the Mothwing Cloak or Shade Cloakability will be 
your best friend in terms  of constantly dashing and avoiding this boss' 
attacks. Note: if you are focused on using your Spells more rather than 
The Nail, make sure you have the Shaman Stoneand Spell Twistercharms 
equipped which will strengthen the damage of spells and reduce the S OUL 
cost of casting spells.Melee Attacks: The Broken Vessel has an increased 
length of The Nail making it easier to inflict damage even from a 
distance. So having a charm equipped such as Longnailor Mark of Pridewill 
make the battle fair, providing The Kni ght an increased range of the 
slash attack coming from The Nail.Stagger: At some point, after landing a 
couple of attacks, you will hear a more prominent slash attack where it 
will cause the boss to stagger. The Broken Vessel will get knocked back 
and will  become motionless with their head tilted back, allowing you to 
follow up with an even stronger attack. The Broken Vessel will recover 
from either not attacking after a brief moment or after hitting them with 
whichever attack you choose to do so.Attacks & CountersAttackCounterPhase 
1Leap AttackThis attack is where the Broken Vessel will try to jump over 
and land on The Knight, dealing damage upon contact. Simply use Mothwing 
Cloak or Shade Cloaktoavoid where it lands.AerialDash SlashThe Broken 
Vessel will j ump and charge mid -air and follow up with a dash attack 
withthe Nail towards The Knight's direction. You can avoid this by 
composing yourself while it charges mid -airfollowed by jumping over it to 
perform a downward strike.Overhead AttackThis attack is qui te tricky as 
it will start up similar to a leap attack, the only difference is after 
charging in place, it will look up before it begins to attack. The Broken 
Vessel will stay in its position only to swing its Nail from left to 
right in an overhead directi on for times. It's best to keep your distance 
and use ranged attacks to continuously deal damage.Aerial SlamWhile 
staying in a spot for a brief moment, The Broken Vessel will jump high on 
top of The Knight, stops, and will slam straight downonto the ground  with 
its Nailfollowing up withreleasing four balloons of infection that will 
slowly float from underneath the ground. It's best to dash before it slams down, and following it up with attacking from above it to also 
avoid the floating projectiles.Ground Da sh SlashSimilar to the Aerial 
Dash Slash, instead of jumping, charging mid -air, and dashing to attack, 
The Broken Vessel will instead charge on the ground and will follow up 
with a dash attack with its weapon towards The Knight. You can simply 
keep your di stance before jumping over it to counter it with a downward 
attack.Spawn AbilityWhile The Broken Vessel keeps you busy with avoiding 
its attacks, it will also spawn Infected Balloonsthat will slowly float 
towards The Knight's direction. You will notice tha t it starts to spawn 
one when you see an orange goo start to form in the air, these beings 
will appear randomly at any point of the battle. It is recommended to 
prioritize taking these balloons out first before The Broken Vessel in 
order to focus on the gr eater threat.Rapids of Infected BalloonsThis 
attack consists of The Broken Vessel violentlybanging its head to release 
rapid waves of Infected Balloons. These balloons will come from 
underneath the ground and float into the air causing it to almost fill 
the area with these blobs. It is highly recommended to keep your distance 
and watch the movement of the balloons in order to avoid it.Broken Vessel 
LoreThe Broken Vessel was once a vessel just like The Knight who was 
created by The Pale King and The White La dy. There are many broken 
vessels that can be found in The Abyss. Vessels were created to perform 
one task, which is to contain The Infection, however, many vessels have 
failed and have perished or broken due to it being unpure to contain its 
power- in order to contain The Infection, the vessel must be pure, it 
must be completely hollow, which implies that a vesselmust have been 
filled with the Void in order to be pure and hollow.Upon encountering the 
Broken Vessel, it may seem like an ordinary corpse of a vessel with a 
broken head. But as soon as you walk in the arena, the path you walked in 
will close, the ground will start to shake and will be filled with dust, 
and Lightseedswill appear and will start to gather into the vessel's 
broken head that will soon  become the Broken Vessel.Once you've defeated 
the Broken Vessel, the large blob of infection blocking the next area at 
the right -hand side will unlock where you will find the Monarch Wings - 
the corpse of the Broken Vessel will remain on the ground where y ou can 
use the Dream Nailon to trigger a Dream Boss Battle, Lost Kin, another 
variant of the Broken Vessel.Broken Vessel Notes & TriviaDefeating the

Mawlek Strategi esStrategy WriteupThe Brooding Mawlek is a difficult boss 
to deal with. As itremains in the middle of the arena, moving left and 
right while executing its attacks - it constantly shoots out blobs of 
infection, has a melee attack using its claws if you get too close and 
later gets aggressive by mixing up its attacks by leaping and covering 
the area with more projectiles.A couple of Charmscan help with defeating 
this boss and increasing your survivability. Charms like Quick Focuswill 
help you recover health q uickly, Thorns of Agonywill allow you to inflict 
damage after taking a hit,as well as theGrubsongcharmthat is also helpful 
as you regain SOUL from taking damage. It is also important that you try 
to keep your distance to avoid any damage, so having the Lon gnailor Mark 
of Pridecharm can make it easier to land your strikeswhile keeping a safe 
distance.For the Spells and Abilities, Desolate Diveis a useful spell as 
you can both avoid any attacks and deal damage at the same time. Vengeful 
Spirit and Shade Soulc an also be used if you want to maximize the 
distance and still inflict damage. So be mindful that if you are coming 
into battle with using your Spells more, be sure to have the Shaman 
Stoneand Spell Twistercharms equipped to elevate the effectiveness of 
your spells.As for how to approach this tricky boss, make sure to have 
the Mothwing Cloakor Shade Cloakabilities as you will be frequently 
dashing and avoiding the blobs it spits out. While it performs its 
spitting attack, always maintain a safe distance and  strike using The 
Nail or Spells to still be able to get a reach of the boss (we will 
assume you have the Longnail or Mark of Pride charms equipped). ALWAYS 
keep your distance since it is useless to stand close to it, as you will 
definitely take damage fro m its claws.Once it starts to become 
aggressive, it will begin to switch up its attack with a leaping attack 
and a vomiting attack - this is where the dash abilities will come in 
handy. For the leaping attack, always remember that the first leap will 
jump towards The Knight's direction, and the second leap will have it 
jump back onto the middle platform. So always dash towards the middle 
during the first leap and dash out towards the left or right side of the 
arena during its second leap.The vomit will be t he most difficult part to 
avoid since it will cover most of the part of the arena with blobs of 
whichever The Knight is standing on. To avoid this, you can simply jump 
and dash towards the opposite area before this creature vomits the 
cluster of blobs. You  will have a brief window of doing this since the 
Brooding Mawlek will need to charge up before it releases the blobs.Also, 
be sure to have The Nail upgraded by speaking to the Nailsmithin order to 
gain a permanent increase of damage to The Knight's primar y 
weapon.Attacks & CountersAttackCounterPhase 1Downward Slash AttackThe 
Brooding Mawlek has a melee attack where if The Knight is quite close to 
the boss' claws, it will raise its claw to perform a downward almost 
forward-like attack. It can execute this a ttack while performing other attacks at the same time. It is recommended to keep a fair distance from 
the boss to avoid any extra damage.Spitting InfectionThis attack is the 
primary attack of the boss where it constantly spits out blobs of 
infected balloon s that shoots towards whichever direction The Knight is 
standing on. It doesn't lock onto the player, but only pops out and lands 
on The Knight's direction.Leaping MawlekThe Brooding Mawlek will lock 
onto The Knight and leap twice towards its direction. To  identify if it 
will start to leap, it will stop moving from side to side and will stay 
in place for a brief moment before leaping in for the attack.Multiple 
VomitThe last attack consists of a projectile attack where the Brooding 
Mawlek will focus for a br ief moment and follow up with vomiting a large 
cluster of infected blobs. These do not lock onto The Knight but covers a 
huge area of whichever The Knight is standing on of the arena.Brooding 
Mawlek LoreThe Brooding Mawlek as per The Hunter is a ferocious yet 
sociable creature who is able to mingle with its own kind. It is the last 
of its kind, so it constantly cries out hoping for another of its kind 
will answer and reunite. However, there are different variations that can 
be found such as the Lesser Mawle kor the Mawlurk, it still is unknown if 
they are different stages of growth for its species or are different from 
one another.This boss battle will begin where once you step inside the 
arena, its paths will be locked and the Brooding Mawlek will jump in fr om 
the background. Defeating it implies that you have killed the last of its 
kind and are extinct - you will be rewarded with a Mask Shardafter the 
battle.Brooding Mawlek Notes & TriviaA smaller Brooding Mawlek can be

by toil and nail bound,Brothers sworn to guard the weak,Masters of the 
sacred ground,Help Us find the God We seek!" - Prayer to th e 
MastersBrothers Oro and Mato LocationGodhomeLast boss in the Pantheon of 
the Master Brothers Oro and Mato RewardsRewards ??Brothers Oro and Mato 
StrategiesStrategy WriteupThe brothers are fought in Godhomeand appear as 
the final boss in the Pantheon of t he Master. Once you start the battle, 
you'll first face off with Oro - Oro fights with three of his attacks, 
the Double Slash, Leap Attack, and his signature Nail Art:Dash Slash. Fighting Oro alone is quite easy since you can dodge most of his attacks 
and you can predict where he will land whenever he performs the leap 
attack. Just be careful of his Dash Slash because this attack allows him 
to dash towards The Knight where he covers most of the arena, so always 
remember to time your jumps or dash/phase thro ugh him.After dealing with 
400 damage, Mato jumps in the arena and fights alongside his brother. 
This is where it gets tricky, Mato's attacks are similar to Oro, the only 
difference is that Mato uses his own signature move, Cyclone Slash, and 
has a shorter  cooldown allowing him to quickly recover and telegraph 
another attack. Another thing to take note off is that they also fight 
defensively where they block The Knight's basic attacks with their 
Nail.Timing your dodges and attacks will be a bit easy for you  since most 
of their attacks require them to charge for a brief moment. If they 
perform their Nail Art attack, they have about a second before they 
actually release the attack. If they try to jump for a leap attack, they 
stop midair allowing you to predict  where they will land and also giving 
you the window to dodge or perfect your spacing to dodge and attack at 
the same time.Being aggressive here is also a fun tactic since the 
brothers tend to stick to each other, you can spam them with your Spells 
by using Shade Soul or Vengeful Spiritallowing you to attack both of 
them. If they try to leap into the air an assurance of landing damage can 
be dealt with by using Abyss Shriek or Howling Wraiths - just be mindful 
that if you plan on using your Spells more often  to equip Shaman Stone 
and Spell Twisterto increase the effectiveness of your spells.At some 
point, there will be moments in the battle where you get cornered and the 
only way to dodge is to dash. If you have the Shade Cloak or Mothwing 
Cloak ability, be s ure to have Sharp Shadowequipped so that you can deal 
damage and evade at the same time.Attacks & CountersAttackCounterPhase 
1Double SlashSimilar to the Watcher Knight, both Oro or Mato will swing 
their Nail twice. First, in a backhand swing followed by an  overhead 
swing, you will need to be mindful since this attack has a good range 
where it can reach The Knight. It can also be performed individually, 
simultaneously or at the same time by the brothers. Just be sure to not 
get in between them and if you are  cornered, dash away using the Mothwing 
Cloak or Shade Cloak ability.Leap AttackOro and Mato can perform this 
attack individually, simultaneously, or at the same time. You can easily 
avoid this attack by dashing if you watch where they will land once they 
leap into the air. There is a brief moment where they will stop mid -air 
before dropping down, however, make sure to keep your distance since they 
immediately jump backward to telegraph another attack.Dash SlashOro 
executes his signature Nail Art, Dash Slas h. You can jump over him twice 
in order to avoid his attack, assuming you have already acquired Monarch 
Wings. You will identify if Oro will use Dash Slash once he charges in 
place and you will have about a second and a half time to jump at the 
right time.  Take note that you will have to jump on him or dash towards 
him since this attack covers the whole arena.Phase 2Brotherly LoveAfter 
Oro takes 400 damage, Mato jumps in to aid his brother in battle. Mato 
has the same basic attacks similar to Oro but instea d performs his 
signature Nail Art in between the battle - both brothers mix -up their 
attacks by either attacking simultaneously, individually or at the same 
time. One of them also blocks your basic attacks.Cyclone SlashAs soon as 
Oro is defeated at the fir st encounter, Mato jumps in to aid his brother. 
Mato performs his signature Nail Art, Cyclone Slash. This attack covers 
most of the arena and allows Mato to land a hit on The Knight because of the range and movement. There are a couple of ways to avoid thi s attack, 
if there is enough space for you to move around, always dash towards Mato 
since his attack starts off with him spinning above the ground and later 
spins back down, so dash towards him if you can to get underneath him. If 
you are cornered and he s tarts to spin, you can climb up the wall and 
jump away to avoid it - you can also pogo off Mato while he spins by 
doing a downward slash in mid -air.Brothers Oro and Mato LoreBrothers Oro 
and Mato are Nailmasters that have been trained by Sly, the great 
Nailsage, alongside their third brother Nailmaster Sheo. Each one of them 
specializes in a Nail Art. When encountered in the main game, they will 
bestow their skills and knowledge upon The Knight.While the three 
brothers seem to have had a falling out in thei r relationship due to an 
unknown and unfinished business that happened in the past, these two seem 
to still have a tight bond and help each other in the 
battlefield.Brothers Oro and Mato Notes & TriviaThe "Brotherhood"

part of a natural life -cycle. Brumm s rebellious thoughts lead him to

Charmsin Ho llow Knightare special Equipment items that provide The Knight 
with buffs, which will help with both traversingHallownest and battling 
its foes. All charms have a Notch Cost, and The Knight will have a Notch 
Limit which gradually increases throughout the g ame. Charms can only be 
equipped and unequipped while The Knight is resting on a Bench.There are 
a total of 45 different Charms available in Hollow Knight, including the 
Charms from the following DLC: Hidden Dreams, The Grimm Troupe, 
Lifebloodand Godmaster .5 oftheCharms in Hollow Knight later turn into a 
different Charm, thus there are only 40 slots for Charms in The Knight's 
inventory. You are not required to complete the game multiple times in 
order to get the "Blessed" achievement; filling up all the Cha rm slots in 
your inventory is enough.Hollow Knight Charm Tier ListBest Charms in 
Hollow KnightThe 45 Charms of Hollow Knight are not all equal in 
effectiveness or worth the Notch Cost they have. There are many Charms in 
the game that are mostly useless unl ess synergised with other Charms, and 
some Charms are a must have for most of the playthrough.This Charm Tier 
List is opinion based but is generally in line with how the community 
feels about each Charm. It also takes into account personal experiences 
and various aspects of the game, such as defeating Pantheon 5 (Pantheon 
of Hallownest)or getting all the Endings. This list is based on how 
useful each Charm is individually, the context of how many situationsit 
is effective in, and how they measure up to thei r Notch Cost.The Charms 
in each tier are not presented in any specific ranking order. However, 
Unbreakable Strength could very well be the best Charm in the game. 
Unbreakable Strength is a Charm that will simply make yourNail do more 
damage. The Nail is th e source for the majority of your damage output, 
meaning this Charm is helpful in a large variety of situations with 
consistent results.TheExploration tier is for Charms that are helpful for 
getting familiar with Hollow Knight. Their use is individual; som e people 
have a worse sense of direction so they need a Wayward Compass, and some 
people like to explore faster so they equip Sprintmaster. These Charms 
are difficult to rate as they have no real combat usage, they are just 
"convinient".**Note that Fragile  versions of Charms bought fromLeg Eater 
are not included in this list; only unbreakable Charms. If you do not 
mind paying the Geo to repair a Fragile Charm, treat them the same as the 
unbreakable versions in this tier list. S  A  B  C  D  Exploration   
Hollow Knight Charms and NotchesCharmsCharmsin Hollow Knight are special 
items that provide The Knight with various buffs. There are a total of 45 
Charms that can be obtained throughout the game. However, there are only 
40 Charm slots in the inventory of The  Knight. The remaining 5 Charms 
will replace their counterparts once you perform certain actions. These Charms includeFragile Greed, Fragile Heart, Fragile Strength, Grimmchild, 
and Kingsoul.NotchesNotchesin Hollow Knight are an item required to equip 
your desired Charms. Each Charm has a Notch Cost. There are a total of 11 
Notches in the game. The Knight starts off with 3 Notches; the other 8 
are found as you progress through the game. Some are sold by Merchants, 
while the others are acquired under certain  conditions, such as beating a 
Boss or gaining an ability.Hollow Knight OvercharmedOvercharmed in Hollow 
Knight is a status The Knight acquireswhich allows them to exceed their 
Notch limit.When a player attempts to equip a Charm that goes beyond the 
maximum number of available Notches, the Charm is denied and sent back to 
the player's inventory. However, upon attmepting to equip another Charm 5 
times,the Overcharmed status will be activated. Note that if all Notches 
are in use, Overcharmed cannot be activat ed. You must have at least 1 
free Notch.You will know you're Overcharmed by the purple aura around 
your health bar. In this status, The Knight will take double damage from 
ALL sources. In order to remove this effect, you must unequip your extra 
Charm.This mechanic is extremely helpful against the Bossesin Hollow 
Knightthat already one -shot the player, such as in the Godmaster DLC on 
Radiant difficulty. For obvious reasons, it's inadvisable to explore new 
areas while Overcharmed.Hollow Knight List of Charms   Gallery View

of Tears WalkthroughEnt eringthe City of TearsTo get to the City of Tears, 
you'll have to retrace your course and head back to the section where you 
saw Hornet. It's the section that has spikes and what seems to be an 
unbuilt bridge. With the Mothwing Cloak, you'll now be able to  reach the 
higher ground and traverse your way by clinging onto the walls and by 
dash-jumping to avoid the thorns. You'll be able to reach two switches 
upon crossing to rebuild the bridge. Once you've reached the far end to 
your right, you'll come across a  large locked gate and a statue of a 
knight next to it. Approach the statue and use the City Crestto unlock 
the gate that leads to the City of Tears - upon entering the gate will 
close causing you to be trapped in the area for the time being.Finding a 
BenchNow that you're locked in, you'll have no other choice but to 
continue forward and into the City of Tears. First, we'll look for the 
first bench. Upon entering the next section, you'll immediately encounter 
new enemies. First is a Belflywhich you'll see c linging on the ceiling, 
once you're within its range it will open its wings to reveal its 
infected body and will dash into your direction and onto the surface 
causing them to explode.As you continue moving forward, you'll find a 
Wandering Husk and Leaping Huskbelow a section that you can enter at the 
top. Continue pushing forward since the door is locked at the top 
section. The next enemy you'll encounter is a Husk Sentry, they can be 
tricky since they'll charge in towards The Knight and swing their weapon 
three times while pushing forward. It's best to deal with them by jumping 
on top and attack by using a downward slash. Once you've killed it, 
continue going to your right and drop down into the opening where you'll 
find 1x Husk Hornhead - kill the enemy, pr oceed to your left and then drop 
down into the next section.Upon entering the next section, there will be 
another Husk Sentrypatrolling, drop down, kill it and continue going 
right and drop down into the opening to find another Husk Sentry. After 
killing i t, walk to your left where you'll find a switch and a lift. Ride 
the lift then hit the switch that is above you to go all the way down, if 
you want to check the middle floor, hit the switch on the lift for it to 
go back up then dash towards the middle floo r to find a tablet for you to

 Cloth   LocationFungal Wastes, Ancient Basin, Queen s 
Gardens,DirtmouthCloth is an NPCin Hollow Knight. Cloth is a burly cicada 
warrior. He can be found traveling throughout Hallownest in search of 
proving his courage by seeking out mighty creatures to battle against. He 
is friendly, though he has doubts about his combat prowess due to his 
true cowardly nature and false bravado.Cloth Informati onCloth is a large, 
brawny, friendly cicada warrior. He set out to Hallownest in order to 
prove his courage by defeating mighty creatures. However, he is rather 
cowardly, and despite displaying a lot of bravado he often hides 
underground to escape foes or to sleep, snoring loudly (making a cicada 
chirp) while doing so. He is motivated by the prospect of dying in an 
epic battle and joining his unknown late friend and companion named 
Nola in the afterlife.Cloth fights by brandishing a large club cut 
from the tooth of an ancient beast.Cloth meets the Knight in various 
locations throughout Hallownest, making a cicada chirp while sleeping 
underground, or hiding. If he is saved in the Ancient Basin, he admits to 
the Knight that he was hiding and that all his bra vado is false. Feeling 
ashamed that he is acting cowardly he begins to doubt himself, but he 
presses on to Queen s Gardens and challenges the tribe of traitor 
mantises who reside there.If you do not save Cloth in the Ancient Basin, 
he will appear in Dirtmo uth, sleeping outside near Sly s shop. He will 
decide to leave Hallownest, having found no challenge he could not 
overcome or die trying.However, if he is met in every location, he will 
join the Knight in the battle withTraitor Lord, in Queen s Gardens. He  
will deal the finishing blow to Traitor Lord with his club, but will 
perish in the battle, impaled by the mantis  claw. Cloth s spirit will 
then appear and speak excitedly to the Knight before he fades and moves 
on to the afterlife to join his friend Nola .Location: Cloth can be found 
at theFungal Wastes.Progression: Cloth moves to theAncient 
Basin,Deepnest, and thenQueen s Gardens.Combat: Players may not kill

we've much in common.Searching for dangerous places aye? Well you're on 
the right track.Along necked critter, warned me of a tribe deeper down. 
Warrior sorts, so she says and I'm itching for some serious 
combat. Curse me and my foolish bravado! If I could shed my pride, I'd 
be asking this tiny warrior for help.  My friend, you dealt with all of 
those beasts?I'm ashamed to say... I was hiding. Those g hastly things 
chased me and I ran. If you hadn't come along, who knows if I'd ever have 
survived.Others take me for a fearsome warrior, what with my impressive 
size, but this kingdom's beasts, I wonder if I'm just no match for 
them?...Enough! I cannot wall ow in my weakness. I must take strength from 
your example!You act so confident in battle. You show no fear before your 
foes. I'll try my best to do the same.  Notes & TipsCloth is a backer 
NPC developed byNoah Sturtridge.On the official Hollow Knight Kicks tarter 
page, Cloth s species and gender are confirmed (despite conflicting 
information provided by unreliable sources). Cloth is a male cicada 
(originally named Burlap) and was developed as such by his backer and Team Cherry themselves. The fact that Clo th emits a cicada chirp while 
snoring also confirms his gender to be male, as only male cicadas can 
chirp.NPCsBardoon,Bretta,Brumm,Charm Lover Salubra,Confessor

Combat in Hollow Knight includes The Knight's close range combat options 
(using their primary weapon, the Nail) and various ranged Spellbased 
attacks. This page will cover the basic combat strategies for fighting 
enemies and b osses.Hollow Knight CombatThe NailThe Knight can attack in 
four directions using the Nail. Performing a down attack while in the air 
allows you to pogo off an enemy, often multiple times in a row. It's the 
most effective way to defeat the first enemies you  encounter. Later on 
you'll have to watch out for enemy moves that guard against this 
attack.Focus MechanicAnother unique combat mechanic is the use of Spells 
and Focus. Hitting enemies with The Nail allows The Knight to gain SOUL, 
which is needed to conju re spell based attacks or to heal.It is essential 
to learn how to heal mid -fight as well as how to sustainably regain SOUL 
in order to win. Some spells are primarily offensive, like a piercing 
fireball which can either go straight left or right. The AoE sp ells allow 
you to hit a wider area around you, but also provide i -frames to phase 
through enemy attacks.ParryingWhile in battle, The Knight can parry 
certain attacks from enemies and bosses. Any incoming attack that has a 
white trace can be parried with ba sic Nail strikes, but not with the use 
of Nail Arts, Spells and Abilities. A successful parry deals full Nail 
damage and provides 0.25 seconds of invulnerability.StaggersStaggering in 
Hollow Knight applies when you stun a boss after successfully landing a 
number of attacks, causing them to be paralyzed for a short period of 
time. This will give the players a window of opportunity to take their 
time to heal or go on the offensive using Spells or Nail Arts. Stagger 
last a few seconds, meaning you can deliver multiple hits. After a few 
hits, the boss will rise again and the fight will continue. Not all 
bosses will stagger, and some will only stagger when their health is low 
enough, triggering the next stage of the fight.

other. We're exquisitely lucky, you and I... I'm a cartographer by trade, 
and I'm working on mapping this area right now. Would you like to buy a 
copy of my work so far?Cornif er Notes & TipsIt is completely unknown how 
he discovers new areas and gets to them. For example, there are only two 
known ways to get to Howling Cliffs.The access from Greenpath is to 
narrow for him, and the access from King's Pass requires parkour that 
would be impossible for him. And yet, he's there. In addition, in Fog 
Canyon, he is literally past a Void Stream, which is impossible to cross 
without the Shade Cloak.If ever you miss Cornifer in the area, you won't 
be able to find him there the second time  around, but he'll leave a note 
saying that you can purchase the map at a higher price by visiting

(Enranged)RewardGeoMask ShardCrystal Guardian is a Boss in Hollow Knight. 
Bosses are spe cial Enemiesthat feature their own arena, a large amount of 
health, and a variety of unique moves and abilities.You will need to 
perform multiple attacks such as using The Nail and Nail Arts along with 
theSpells and Abilitiesin order to defeat them. Some b osses are capable 
of entering into a state of stagger after landing a number of attacks on 
them.As soon as you encounter a boss,its name will appear on the screen, 
the music will change into a boss battle theme, and usually, 
pathsconnecting the arena will close or will be blocked leaving you no 
choice but to face these devastating and unique foes.Heavyset miner of the Crystal Peak overcome by crystal growth. Can discharge blazing beams 
of light from its crystallised limbs.How does the world look to this

ShardUnlocks a Bench.Crystal Guardian StrategiesStrategy W riteupTo start 
this fight, you'll find the guardian sleeping on a bench. Simply strike 
it to initiate the battle. The Crystal Guardianmay keep you on your toes 
since it will frequently call forth a rain of crystal beams and mixes its 
movement and tactics m aking itself unpredictable.Charms: If at the early 
stage of the game you accidentally initiate the battle, it is recommended 
to at least have the Dashmastercharm in order to evade and move around 
the arena at a quicker rate. Quick Focuswill also allow you to cast your 
spells at a faster rate allowing you to keep up with the pace of this 
boss. Quick Slashis also useful to have equipped to quickly land your 
attacks since the Crystal Guardian is always open to take damage while it 
uses its laser beam attack.Sp ells and Abilities: Using any offensive 
spell on the Crystal Guardian will work, but it is wise to take note of 
equipping certain charms like Shaman Stoneand Spell Twisterin order to 
improve the effectiveness of your spells. Upgrading the Mothwing Cloakto 
the Shade Cloakis also recommended in order to phase through the boss' 
attacks.When facing the Crystal Guardian, it is a good practice to take 
your time and watch out for where the beams from the sky are directed. 
Take your time to move your position and o nce it uses its laser beam 
attack, jump overto get behind it and follow up with attacking it with 
The Nail. Your spells can also work like Vengeful Spiritallowing you to 
inflict damage from afar as well as Desolate Diveor Descending Darkwill 
allow you to i nflict damage while avoiding its attacks.Attacks & 
CountersAttackCounterFirst EncounterBeams from AboveThe Crystal Guardian 
will shout out a loud cry where multiple beams of energy will shoot down 
from above. To identify where it will land, the beams will start off as a 
thin line and after a short moment will open as a crystal beam that deals 
damage upon contact. The Crystal Guardian can perform this move while 
performing other attacks.Crystal Laser BlastThis is the Crystal 
Guardian's primary attack. The Cr ystal Guardian will lean back and raise 
its hand to shoot out a laser blast towards The Knight's direction. 
Similar to how the beams from the sky work, it begins with a thin line 
and after a short moment will enlarge into a blast that deals damage upon 
contact.Leaping GuardianThe Crystal Guardian leaps around the arena as 
its way to move around the area and to avoid The Knight's attacks. This 
move can be performed in conjunction with its two attacks.Second 
Encounter (Enranged Crystal Guardian)Beams from Abo veThis attack is 
similar to how it works at the first encounter, the only differencesare 
the Crystal Guardian now stomps on the ground violently while 
screaming,the color has changed from pink to orange, the beams are 
faster, and it deals 2 masks damage up on contact.Crystal Laser BlastAlso 
similar to how it worked at the first encounter but is now channeled 
faster, deals more damage, and the color has changed from pink to 
orange.Leaping GuardianPerformed at a much faster rate and uses it 
aggressively in con junction with its two attacks.Crystal Guardian LoreThe 
Crystal Guardian was once a normal bug working as a miner. As time 
passed, eventually its work has consumed its mind by losing itself, 
mutated its body by being covered in crystal, and succumbed to The  
Infection. What the Crystal Guardian sees behind its crystallized head is unknown.Crystal Guardian Notes & TriviaThe Crystal Guardian is one of the 
bosses that can be fought twice. At first, you will find it resting on a 
bench and after defeating it, it w ill jump up onto the second level of 
the area. You will need to have the Mantis Clawand Monarch Wingsabilities 
in order to reach the second arena of the boss.If you haveDefender's 
Crestequipped, the cloud surrounding The Knight will cause the Crystal 
Guardian to wake up from the bench, triggering the boss

WalkthroughThe Path to the Crystal PeakOnce you've defeated the Soul 
Masterat the Soul Sanctum, make your way back to Dirtmouthand purchase 
the Lumafly Lanternfrom Sly. From there, jump down into the well that 
will take you to the Forgotten Crossroads then head east, past the  Temple 
of the Black Eggand into the next two sections. Continue heading east 
until you reach an opening you can drop down to. From here, there are two ways to enter the Crystal Peak. We'll first explain how to get there with 
the use of the Lumafly Lantern .Once you're at the lower part of the 
section, go left, then head down into the exit by the gazebo -like 
structure, followed by going down one level and into the next section to 
your right. With the Lumafly Lantern,you'll now be able to see through 
the dark  with the help of the item. Walk further east until you reach a 
toll machine that will require you to pay 50 Geo to unlock the gate in 
front of you.Upon entering, you'll encounter new enemies below you which 
are 2x Glimback. Drop down to where the enemies are, kill it, then 
continue going right to find a cluster of geo. If you continue to your 
right, you can break the wall to continue onto the path leading to the 
Crystal Peak.For the 2nd path, head back outside, then back up to the 
gazebo-like structure, fo llowed by the previous section to your right. 
Once you've arrived, continue going right into the cave -like entrance 
that has a pink light. Continue going right then drop down into the 
opening to find an NPC named Myla, she is a miner similar to the other 
bugs who later on succumbs to The Infection as you progress through the 
game.After talking to her, go back up, continue going right and hop onto 
the lift that will automatically go up once you stand on it. There is a 
Soul Totem that you can find in the midd le level, if you need it, dash 
midway into the platform to find it at the left -hand side - when you're 
done, head to the top and go right into the next section.From here, if 
you walk a bit further, you'll notice that the floor is breakable. This 
is another  path that you can take by using the Desolate Divespell. Upon 
using the spell, try to jump and dash to your right to find 1x Rancid 
Egg.Finding a BenchAssuming you've taken the path by breaking the floor 
with the Desolate Dive ability, head all the way dow n where you'll 
encounter a Glimback. From here, go east where you'll encounter platforms 
that are also conveyors. Jump across the conveyors and continue heading 
east where you'll encounter a Husk Minerand the bench at the very 
end.Further into the Crystal PeakWhen you're done resting, you'll want to 
head up to where the bench is and enter the next section. From here 
you'll encounter a Crystal Hunter, these beings are tricky since they 
will shoot a crystal and will expand into a cluster of crystal once it 
lands on any surface. After killing it, head up to the 3rd level to find 
2x Husk Minerguarding 2x cluster of Geo that is covered in crystal. Once 
you're done, head up to the next level and proceed west into the next 
section.You'll find yourself in a room whe re there are metal platforms. 
These platforms will flip over revealing the crystalized platform after a 
short moment once you jump on it, so be quick and make your way to the 
top left -hand side of the room to find 1x Rancid Egg. After collecting 
the item, head back to the room where the bench is, only this time you'll 
want to head left and climb up the walls towards the northwest and into 
the next section. Along the way, you'll also encounter a Husk Minerby a 
cluster of geo.Upon arriving into the next secti on, you'll encounter a 
Glimbackjust above you and 2 more Husk Miner. Now ride the conveyor 
that's on the wall and proceed east where you'll see another Glimback. 
Kill it and continue going up where you'll now see walls that have spikes 
on it.From the middl e column, jump onto the conveyor and make your way 
around the spikes to reach the Grub that is on the top. You should be 
going counterclockwise to reach the Grub. Once you reach the grub, free 
it from the jar then hit the switch to unlock the gate in front  of you 
and head up into the next section.Now, you'll encounter a new enemy 
called a Crystal Crawler. These beings crawl around the surface and shoot out a laser beam for every 2 -3 second's interval and are invulnerable to 
your basic attacks, the only way to kill these enemies is by using the 
Vengeful Spirit spell. Jump onto the platform above you first to find a 
cluster of Geo.Finding CorniferAfter collecting the Geo, climb to the top 
and head to the northwestern side of the room where you'll find Cornifer . 
Along the way, you'll encounter more Crystal Crawler, spiked paths, and 
you'll also find pieces of paper scattered around which indicated that 
Cornifer is near.Once you reach the top, head left where the sign is 
pointing and into the next section to find  Cornifer. Speak to him to 
purchase a copy of the map of Crystal Peak for 112 Geo.Obtain the 
Shopkeeper's KeyAfter buying the map from Cornifer, head back to the 
previous room and this time head up to the next section. You should find 
yourself in a section  that seems to be where more of the Husk Miner is 
working, Glimback, and a new enemy called aShardmite. Head to the left -
hand side and make your way to the 2nd level where you'll notice a bench 
sign to your right, ignore that for the moment and continuecli mbingup the 
column where the Shardmite is until you reach the top northeastern side 
to find a chest that has the Shopkeeper's Key in it, you can give this 
key to Sly in Dirtmouth to unlock more items. Once you've collected the 
key, prepare for a boss battl e and head back down to the platform that 
has a bench sign andhead into the next section.Boss Battle, Crystal 
GuardianOnce you're inside, you'll notice a creature sleeping on the 
bench. This is the Crystal Guardianand the only way for you to use the 
bench is to fight him. If you're ready to fight him, strike the guardian 
with the nail and he will wake up, prompting the gates to close and the 
boss battle to begin. You can click hereto learn more about the 
strategies to defeat this boss. Once you defeat him, he will drop Geo and 
will leap up to a higher level. You can now use the Bench but you won't 
be able to reach him yet until you acquire the Monarch Wingsability - for 
now just save and replenish your health.The Crystal HeartFrom the arena 
of the Crystal Gu ardian, head to the right and into the next section to 
find a switch that will unlock the first gate. Once that's done, retrace 
your course back to where you found the Shopkeeper's Key and head to the 
top exit where you'll find Quirrelat the left overlooki ng the area. After 
speaking to him, head east at the very end until you reach the next 
section and then drop down into the opening - if you slide down onto the 
wall, you can dash towards the middle section where you'll encounter 
multiple Crystal Crawler, a  cluster of Geo, and 1x Wanderer's Journalat 
the top left corner next to a corpse of a bug. Once you've collected the 
items, jump back onto the wall and climb up one level where you'll 
encounter 2x Husk Miner.Clear the path and walk near the end where you' ll 
come across a breakable floor, use the Desolate Diveability where you'll 
find 2 more clusters of Geo and a Bluggsaccontaining 1x Rancid Eggthat is 
being guarded by 2x Crystal Hunter. After collecting the items, climb 
back up and drop down onto the middl e column towards the switch, hitting 
it will unlock the gate that is next to it.Now, you'll want to slide down 
the wall where a Shardmiteis crawling which is the one to your right, 
then head all the to the bottom where you'll find another switch to your 
left that will open a shortcut and another section to your right. Flip 
the switch then proceed east.You'll now enter a section that has multiple 
elevated platforms and conveyors. Jump across the conveyors and then onto 
the platforms to your right, followed b y clinging onto the wall that has 
a conveyor, be mindful and time your dashes right since you'll be passing 
through a path that has spikes. When you reach the top, you'll find a breakable wall to your left that has a SOUL totem - if you need to 
replenish S OUL, strike the totem to extract the SOUL from it.When you're 
done, continue going east towards a path that has crystal beams shooting 
from the ceiling. Avoid it by dashing at the right time until you reach 
another end that has more elevated platforms and conveyors.Upon reaching 
the end, you'll find another SOUL totem that you can extract SOUL 
from.Now, head to the bottom left and then go right until you reach the 
end of the wooden bridge where you'll find the Crystal Heartability. Upon 
consuming the abilit y, the bridge next to you will collapse which will 
allow you to try out the new ability - with the Crystal Heart consumed, 
you'll now be able to traverse areas that have a long gap by 
concentrating energy and releasing it to blast forward and fly through 
the air. This can be executed while on the ground or if you are clinging 
onto a wall. The next location we'll need to head off to is the 
Crystalised Mound.Acquiring the Deep Focus CharmBefore you head off to 
the Crystalised Mound, you can grab the Deep Focu s charm which is located 
here. To get there, you'll have to retrace your course back to the 
section that leads to Cornifer, you'll find the entrance to the crystal 
cave at the west -hand side which is below the elevated platform that has 
a piece of paper on  it. With the Crystal Heartability, you'll now be able 
to cross the other end. However, the path is quite tricky since you'll 
have to time the ability right to avoid getting hit by the crystal beams. 
Eventually, you'll reach the west end side where you'll see another 
section. Enter it to find yourself inside a cave full of crystals - 
you'll find the Deep Focuscharm at the bottom. You can head back to the 
entrance by going up and through the conveyor.A Grub MimicYou can rescue 
another Grub by heading to anot her path you can now cross. Make your way 
back to the section where you found Corniferthen use the Crystal 
Heartability to get across, you'll have to continue traveling west until 
you reach the end that has a section that you can jump down below into 
and another section to your left which will take you back to 
Dirtmouth.For now, you'll want to go down deeper into the cavern where 
you'll encounter 2x Crystal Hunter. Kill the enemies and continue going 
down to the bottom where you'll find a Grub trapped in a jar. Be cautious 
since this is an enemy that has the ability to mimic bugs, upon breaking 
the jar, it will reveal its true form, a Grub Mimicthat will attack you 
once it's out of the jar. Once you kill it, walk to the wall to your 
right and hit it with The  Nail to break it - follow the path, climb up to 
find the real Grub. Free it from the jar and head back up to the crystal 
cavern then proceed west to find a lift that can take you back to 
Dirtmouth.Video[video goes here]MapClick on the image to enlarge the

the Crystal Heartability, activate it to dash across the room heading 
west. You'll want to walk up to where a giant bug can be seen from behind 
then cling onto the wall followed by using the Crystal Heartability to 
reach the G rub which is to your right. After freeing the Grub, head back 
down, head back outside, then drop down into the next section.You'll want 
to drop down all the way to the bottom and through the path that has 
crushers. But before heading through that path, whi le sliding down the 
wall, you can dash through an opening midway where you can find a cluster 
of Geo that is being guarded by about 4x Husk Mineralongside 2x Crystal 
Crawler. Once you've collected the Geo, head back down to the path with 
the crushing mecha nisms until you reach an exit that you can drop down 
into - you can continue going right and onto the conveyor with the 
crushers then back up where you'll find a chest containing Geo. You can 
easily go around by hitting the switch on the ceiling to unlock the gate 
next to it but you'll have to make another round trip and pass the 
crushers.Upon reaching the exit that you can jump down to, you'll find 
another trapped Grub. Free it, then activate the switch on your right to 
unlock the gate. After that's done, head down two levels until you reach 
a section that you can enter that is on your right.You should find 
yourself in a dark cave that has multiple elevated platforms alongside 
Crystal Hunters that are flying around and a Glimbackat the end. You must 
have the Lumafly Lantern item to be able to pass, if you don't have it, 
you'll have to head back to Slyin Dirtmouth and buy it from him for 1800 
Geo. To continue, head east by using the elevated platforms until you 
reach the next section - upon entering, use the Crystal Heartability to 
cross the gap where you'll now find yourself at the entrance of the 
grotto. There is also a SOUL Totem next to it if you need to replenish 
your SOUL.Acquiring the Descending DarkUpon entering you'll come across a 
breakable floor, wa lk on it and then use Desolate Diveto break it. Upon 
reaching the bottom, destroy the wooden barricade to your right and make 
your way across by platforming and simply follow the path while avoiding 
or fighting the Crystal Hunter. Eventually, you'll come a cross a 
Shardmiteand more elevated platforms. From here, you'll want to try to 
head to the top left, then midway upon reaching a safe surface, continue 
going up, only this time towards the top right to rescue another 
Grub.Now, from where the Grub was, head  back down the platforms, then 
onto the safe surface. You'll want to jump onto the elevated platform to 
your left then do a short jump followed by dashing to cling onto the 
wall. Climb up and walk on top of the wooden floor, hit it with The 
Nailto break it  and you'll reach the corpse of thelivingSnail Shaman's 
fourth relative who is encased in crystals. Continuously strike the 
crystalized corpse until it breaks, and upon breaking it, you'll be able 
to consume the Descending Darkability that upgrades the Des olate 
Diveability. From here, you can head back outside to the entrance and

DeepnestThere are two ways to get into Deepnest, first i s through the 
Mantis Village via the arena of the Mantis Lordsand second is dropping 
down into the area via the Fungal Wastes, it is recommended to enter 
Deepnest by dropping into the area via the Fungal Wasteswhere you can 
acquire 1x Mask Shard. From here , walk a bit to either the right or left 
side and the ground will break where you'll respectively find yourself in 
Deepnest. Now, head left and climb up the first passage you see then 
continue going to the top -left corner of the room to find Corniferhiding  
behind a rock, speak to him to buy a copy of the map for 38 Geo.Acquiring 
a Vessel FragmentOnce you've acquired the map, continue going west, 
around the narrow caverns and then all the way down to find a Hot Spring 
and a bench for you to use. From the ben ch, to your right you'll be 
entering a section that has narrow passageways that are filled with 
Garpedeenemies, these creatures are considered as environmental hazards 
and cannot be killed. Before acquiring the Vessel Fragment, you'll want 
to take a detour  and further explore the area.Upon entering the narrow 
passageways, head east until you reach an opening that you can drop down 
into. From here, you can dash to your left to find a secret room 
containing a corpse of a Garpede, inspecting it will allow you toadd 
details regarding the enemyin the Hunter's Journal. Continue sliding down 
the wall and then dash through the opening to your right to find a path 
that is being blocked by a stream of void. This path leads to the Sharp 
Shadowcharm but can only be cros sed if you've upgraded the Mothwing 
Cloakability into the Shade Cloak. So for now, head back up into the 
previous section where the Garpedes are. Another point of interest that 
you can find is the Ancient Tramway, and in order for you to reach it, 
you'll h ave to go through the narrow passageways and try to head 
southeast until you reach the entrance leading to the tram.For now, you 
can ignore that and try to make your way to the northwestern side of the section until you reach a section you can jump up to. Once you've 
arrived, you'll notice that you'll be standing on the edge of the surface 
and that you'll have to cross to make it to the other side. In order to 
cross, you'll have to pogo off the Garpedewhile it moves. Eventually, 
you'll reach the end where y ou'll encounter a Garpedecrawling vertically

the 2nd level and then activate the Crystal Heartability to fly across to 
your left. Once you've landed on the wall, hit it with The Nail to 
destroy the wall which reveals a secret path leading to the Grub. You'll 
find the little critter just below the secret room.The Path to NoskAfter 
freeing the Grub, you can find another secret path tha t leads to an 
optional boss called Nosk. From where the Grub was, jump up onto the 
ledge and strike the wall with The Nail which will break that reveals a 
secret path. This path leads to the den of the creature who has the 
ability to mimic the image of any  bugs and uses it to lure its prey into 
its lair. Simply follow the path where you'll find a mimic of The Knight 
as you push through, and eventually, you'll end up in the arena of this 
boss.Boss Battle, NoskUpon entering the arena, you'll find your

Mightystruggling. In order to reach him, you'll have to work your way 
around the section counterclockwise until you reach a mini -arena filled 
with multiple Corpse Creepers where you'll have to fight three waves of 
these enemies. After survivin g the last wave, the web that is blocking 
the path at the bottom right will disappear, allowing you to enter the 
section where Zote is. You'll find him entangled in the webs, hit the web 
once to free him then speak to him. After that's done, head west unti l 
you reach the end where you can pick up 1x King's Idolthen retrace your 
steps back the way you entered until you reach a sign that points out to 
a bench, follow it to reach a bench near thefailedtramway.Rescue a 
GrubUpon reaching the bench, head back dow n one level and go east until 
you reach the next section. You should find yourself inside another 
section that has narrow passageways and Garpedes. Make your way to the 
top and into the next section where you'll find small platforms and pits 
filled with bu gs and spikes.From here, you'll have to reach the section 
that is on the top northeastern side of the room. And in order to get 
there, head west from the pit and platforms and jump up to the 2nd level. Simply follow the path until you reach the top which r equires you to use 
the Crystal Heartability to fly across the other side, once you've made

leading into the next section.The Grub is located inside a secret room. 
And in order to find that room, simply walk east until you reach the end 
then climb up the wall onto the ledge. You can break the wall with The 
Nail which opens up the entrance into the secret room that is filled with 
Grubs.Now, do not break the jars first once you see the Gru b. There is a 
total of 4 jars in the room where three of these are Mimics and only one 
is the true Grub. You'll find the third Grub to be the real one among the 
rest. After rescuing the little critter, head back to the bench near 
thefailed tramway to save your game.The Distant VillageMake your way to 
the far west side of the map where you'll find yourself at the distant 
village. From here, head to the center of the room and enter the 
structure. You'll find a couple of Distant Villagersinside and a bench in 
the middle of the room, if you speak to them, they'll welcome you and 
advise you to take a rest and sit on the bench.Upon sitting on the bench, 
an eerie sound will begin to play and The Knight will find himself stuck 
on the bench, the villagers will then w alk up to The Knight and the 
screen will turn black. A few moments later, The Knight will awaken stuck 
in a web. Keep pressing the attack button to break out of the web - 
you'll now find yourself in the Beast's Den.The Beast's DenThe Beast's 
Den is where y ou can find the chambers of one of the Dreamers, Herrah the 
Beast. So make sure you find her body before leaving the area. Upon 
breaking free from the web, head east and make your way to the top area 
of the location. Simply follow the path and head all the  way to the top 
where you'll find the body of Herrah the Beast. Use the Dream Nailon her 
to enter the Dream World where you'll find her vulnerable state -once you 
find her, simply hither a few times with the nail and use FOCUS to 
absorbher which will cause her seal on the Temple of the Black Egg to 
break.After destroying Herrah, and if you've foughtHornetin Kingdom's 
Edge, Hornet will appear and we'll learn that Herrah is her mother. From 
here, head to the bottom left where you'll find a bench and an opening  
that will take you back to where the Distant Villagers were.Up next,

ObjectivesDeliver a pure undamaged Delicate Flowerto the grave of the 
Traitor's Child in Queen's Gardens.Delicate Flower LocationsResting 
GroundsDelicate Flower WalkthroughTo start the quest, head to the east 
end of the Resting Grounds and speak  to Grey Mourner.She will provide a 
quest to deliver a Delicate Flowerto the grave of the Traitor's Child 
located at the Queen's Gardens.However, before doing the quest, it is 
recommended to do the following for you to have an accessible path. 
First, you w ill have to obtain Isma's Tearin order to gain access into 
the Queen's Gardens which is by acquiring the Crystal Heartfor traversing 
the area and by defeating theDung Defenderat the Royal Waterways. Second, 
is to unlock the shortcut leading to a stag stati on since it is the same 
path that you can go through to get to the grave. Third, make sure to do 
this quest before the Forgotten Crossroadshas been filled with The 
Infected for the navigation to be easy - obtainingMonarch Wingsor by 
killing one of the Drea merswill cause The Infection to spread through the 
Forgotten Crossroads causing the area to change certain paths and enemies 
will become stronger and difficult to avoid. And finally, make sure to 
have the Dreamgateability.Now, once you've considered follow ing the three 
recommended steps and have acquired the Delicate Flower, to start off you 
can place a Dreamgate next to the bench beside the Grey Mourner's Mansion 
but make sure to not use the Dreamgate while you are delivering the 
flower - also take note th at the flower can wither into a Ruined Flowerif 
The Knight takes damage from an enemy or environmental hazard and by 
using aThe Stagways or a Dreamgate for fast travel.Once that's done, you 
can start tomake your way to the grave, the convenient route to de liver 
the flower from point a to point b is from the Resting Grounds, through 
the tram station connecting the Forgotten Crossroadsor by passing the 
Blue Lakethat also connects the Forgotten Crossroads, followed by the Fog 
Canyon and through the shortcut th at leads to the path of the grave in 
the Queen's Gardens. IF along the way the flower breaks, simply return to 
the Grey Mourner and speak to her to request for another flower.To remove 
nearly every enemy along the path shown below, thus making the trip 
significantly easier to accomplish without taking damage, it is also 
recommended that you travel the pathway fully once, killing any enemy 
that could threaten you along the way. Begin from the Grey Mourner's 
Mansion and travel to the Traitor's Child memorial fully once, even if 
you take damage. Do not rest at any benches along the way. Once you 
arrive at the Traitor's Child, Dreamgate back to the Grey Mourner's 
Mansion. Do not rest at the bench outside. Get another flower and travel 
the same exact pathway you just cleared. Only a handful of the weakest 
enemies will have respawned, making the your job much easier. If you take 
damage, Dreamgate back for another flower but do not rest.You can click 
on the image to enlarge it.After you've reached the Queen's Garden s, 
inspect the grave and the ghost of the Traitor's Child will appear and 
thank you by bowing down to The Knight - now if you've placed the 
Dreamgate before setting off, you can easily teleport back to the Grey 
Mourner's Mansion, or if you haven't, simply head back on foot or by 
using fast travel.Once you've returned to the Resting Grounds, speak to the Grey Mourner in her mansion to let her know that the request is done 
and she will be surprised that her lastwish has been fulfilled and her 
grieving has end ed. This marks the completion of the quest and she will 
disappear and will leave you with a Mask Shardas a reward as well as 
unlocking the Solace Trophy/Achievement.Delicate Flower Notes & Notable

Hollow Knight at his weakest phase. She will jump in to restrain the 
Hollow Knight, and instead of striking him with The Nail, immediately use 
the Awoken Dream N ailto be transported into the Hollow Knight's mind to 
face The Radiance.After striking the Radiance one last time, the battle 
will end with The Knight shifting into his Shade along with the Hollow 
Knight. The Hollow Knight (in his Shade form) tears open th e face of the 
Radiance with his powerful hands, exposing the Radiance s core of false 
light, and encouraging his brother to finish him off. With the Radiance 
fully paralyzed and held by the Hollow Knight, the Knight strikes at the 
ominously glowing core re peatedly, completely destroying the Radiance s 
evil spirit. A short cinematic will follow, where you'll find 
Hornetbarely surviving in the temple. She wakes up to find that The 
Infection has beenexpelled; she sees The Knight's shell broken in half - 
which implies that The Knight has returned to the Void, sacrificing 
himself, along with the Hollow Knight. Acquiring this ending unlocks the

Defender LocationRoyal WaterwaysDung Defender RewardsDefender's 
CrestAccess to Isma's GroveDung Defender StrategiesStrategy Writeup The 
Dung Defender's behavior consists of him trying to close the gap and to 
get close to The Knight. He likes to move around the arena while keeping 
you busy with forming dung balls that bounce around for a few seconds. 
Charms such as Thorns of Agony can s eal the deal with landing an attack 
since if you are caught in between its attacks, you can guarantee an 
attack will land from the thorns that come out from The Knight after 
taking damage. Equipping the Quick Focuscharm can also save you the time 
of recove ring your health while maneuvering the arena.At the beginning of 
the fight, take your time to avoid the balls and close in for the attack 
once he stops forming it. Strike once, step back, avoid the dung, and 
strike again after he stops forming one, rinse a nd repeat. Another tactic 
that can be used, esp when he enters his frenzy mode is to use Desolate 
Diveor Descending Darkwhile he is burrowed into the ground. Doing this 
will cause him to emerge out of the ground and will get knocked out for a 
brief moment. As for evading, you can simply strike the dung balls with 
The Nail if it lands on you for it to bounce off towards a different 
direction.Attacks & CountersAttackCounterPhase 1Dung ThrowThe Dung 
Defender gathers dung and throws one or two balls that bounce around the 
arena and disappears after a few seconds. This inflicts damage upon contact but it can be bounced off before it lands on you by striking it 
with The Nail with an upward attack.Defender's DiveLike a dolphin, the 
Dung Defender will dive into the g round and emerge out which deals damage 
upon contact. Since the height of how it emerges from the ground is low, 
you can either jump and dash towards the opposite direction or keep your 
distance.Bursting AttackSimilar to its dive, the Dung Defender will di ve 
into the ground but this time will remain underneath and will try to move 
towards The Knight's position. after a brief moment, the Dung Defender 
will emerge out of the ground where it jumps high and springs out four 
small dung balls. These balls do not bounce around the area and are 
destroyed uponlanding on the ground - these can also be avoided by 
hitting it with The Nail for it to change its direction.Curled up 
DefenderIn conjunction with the Dung Throw attack, the Dung Defender 
curls into a ball and b ounces off the arena along with the dung balls. 
You can simply strike its shell to inflict damage and also changing its 
direction of where it will bounce off to.Phase 2FrenzyAt some point, 
after inflicting damage, the Dung Defender will enter a frenzied ph ase. 
He will start off with releasing a loud battle cry and will acquire 
increased speed, shorter recovery rate, and mix -ups with its attacks. 
This state only happens once.Dung Defender LoreThe Dung Defender is both 
a boss and NPC in the game. Ogrim being his real name, he was once a 
memberof the Five Great Knights of Hallownest who was considered as the 
most loyalwarriorof the five, and fights for honor and glory. After Grey 
Mourner s death, and Hegemol s unknown status, Ogrim might be the only 
survivor ou t of the five great warriors. Heis found in Royal 
Waterways.Though quite jolly in demeanor, he mistakes The Knight to be an 
enemy and initiates a battle. After defeating him, Ogrim will apologize 
and mentions The Knight's worthy and is capable of saving Ha llownest. If 
players successfully defeat all three Dreamers, he will move to his cave 
where you will find him sleeping - this will give players the chance to 
use the Dream Nail to enter in his dream and challenge the White 
Defender. Right after fighting th e White Defender five times, he will 
wake up and mentions how he can picture The Knight to be worthy to be 
with the greatest heroes. After leaving the area and returning, the Dung

where one of them is fast and requires you to look at the positioning of 
the rings to avoid getting hit while the other attack gives you time to 
dash away before getting hit. Elder Hu constantly teleports and floats 
around the arena so it is recommended that you have Defender's

Infection. Once he reached the Mantis Village, he saw that the Mantis 
Lords and the tri be have been consumed and tried to kill all of them but

 Elderbug   LocationDirtmou thElderbug is an NPCin Hollow Knight. Elderbug 
is the oldest resident of Dirtmouthwho gives advice to those who speak to 
him.Elderbug InformationElderbug is the oldest bug and resident of the fading town of Dirtmouth, and the first NPC The Knight will enco unter. He 
was not present in Hallownest during the fall of the kingdom and the 
spread of The Infection, though he knows some information about it. 
During your first encounter with him, he mentions that the previous 
residents of Dirtmouth have fled towards the depths of Hallownest, and 
warns The Knight to take extra caution when descending. Elderbug also 
tends to be quite pessimistic. He enjoys seeing new residents in town 
(such as Bretta and the shopkeepers). However, he will express fear of 
the Grimm Troup e when they arrive. His pessimistic attitude improves when 
he is given a Delicate Flower.Location: Elderbug Can be found at

Knight Hunter's Journal List in OrderThere exist a total of 168 logs in 
the Hunter's Journal(164 not including special items), and if a specific 
set of 146 are completed it will award The Knight with the Hunter 's Mark. 
Below is a list of the Enemies in the order that the Hunter's Journal 
uses, which you can use to compare with your own Hunter's Journal to find 
the Enemies you have not logged yet.In the table below, some Enemies are 
not required for the Hunter's Mark; Those Enemies have been highlighted 
in dark purple, and do not need to be logged for you to acquire the 
Hunter's Mark. No. Name Description 1  Crawlid  Timid scavenger that 
crawls through the caverns looking for food. Dull and pathetic. Hardly 
worth killing. 2  Vengefly  Flying predator that pursues its prey 
relentlessly. This fierce little hunter will bravely chase down creatures 
many times its size. Admirable! It is weak though, and I have devoured 
hundreds of them with little effort or care. 3 Veng efly King  Patriarch 
of a vengefly colony. Swoops at intruders and cries out for 
reinforcements if threatened. A filthy creature that is happy to chew on 
any old thing it finds discarded on the cavern floor. When it notices a 
threat it will annoyingly scre am and shriek, so kill it swiftly. 4  
Gruzzer  Simple -minded creature that haphazardly buzzes around, bumping 
into things. They only seem dimly aware of their surroundings, making 
them easy prey to cut your fangs on. What is it that guides them on their 
paths? It almost seems like they search for ways to die. 5 Gruz Mother  
Mature gruzzer that carries its young in its belly. Attacks by hurling 
its huge body around. Bizarrely, this monster does not lay eggs but 
instead carries its young inside of its fat sto mach. This strange practice seems to exhaust the creature, making it sleepy and vulnerable. 
Take advantage! 6  Tiktik  Uses its small, sharp claws to climb along 
walls and rooves. Spends its time tap -tap-tapping its way through the 
roads and caverns near t he surface of this kingdom. If you're patient, 
you can wait for it to come to you and pick it off. 7  Aspid Hunter  
Bests its prey by spitting corrosive liquid. Often hunts in packs. 
Cunning predators that will try to pick you off from a distance. Don't 
give them any space, just charge in and cut them down! You'll find 
they're not so cunning once they are dead. 8 Aspid Mother  Carries the 
eggs of its young inside its belly. Can hatch and birth its young as 
needed to deal with intruders. Shamelessly uses its  own young as a weapon 
against its foes! Appalling, yes, but I do admire its resourcefulness. 
Good hunters do not always make good parents. 9  Aspid Hatchling  
Recently birthed, these young aspid instinctively swarm around intruders. 
These hatchlings are b orn with an instinct to kill! They are still only 
infants though, and you can crush them between your fangs without 
thinking. Just don't let them overwhelm you with numbers. 10  Goam  
Thickly armoured, it bursts from the ground to seize prey in its fangs. 
These brutes seem to be impervious to most damage, so you can sharpen 
your weapons on their thick hide or just slash away at them for your own 
amusement. They barely seem to notice. 11  Wandering Husk  The remains of 
a bug, animated by a strange force. Wan ders the roads where it once 
lived. These "civilised" bugs of Hallownest were weak in life and now 
they are equally weak in death. Send them back into the dirt they were 
born in! 12 Husk Hornhead  The remains of a bug, animated by a strange 
force. Uses its  horn to attack any uninfected creature it finds. These 
bugs have an arrogant air about them, even after dying. Overly proud of 
their long horns! I enjoy snapping them off. 13  Leaping Husk  The 
remains of a bug, animated by a strange force. It will instin ctively leap 
at uninfected creatures to attack them. The bugs of old Hallownest did 
not hunt their own food, they had it brought to them. That's why they 
were so weak. That's why their kingdom crumbled into dust and faded away! 
14  Husk Bully  The remains of a bug, animated by a strange force. It 
aggressively attacks any uninfected creature it finds. A thick orange 
mist fills these walking corpses. It has a sweet, sickly taste to it. I 
find it foul. After you kill these creatures, I suggest you do not eat 
them. 15  Husk Warrior  The remains of a bug, animated by a strange 
force. Wields a nail and shell. Softened by generations of luxury, these 
bugs lack claws or armour or venom. Those who wish to protect themselves 
are forced to fashion weapons from stone, o re or shell. 16  Husk Guard  
The remains of a great Hallownest Crossguard, animated by a strange 
force. Instinct still drives it to guard its post against intruders. 
Larger and stronger than their brothers, these bugs are still forced to 
steal their weapon s from the remains of other creatures. They do not roam 
or hunt, forever standing guard and lashing out at anything that wanders 
near. 17  Entombed Husk  Mummified remains, deformed and enraged by 
infection. Inside these shambling corpses is a bright light  that pierces 
any darkness. I peered inside that light once and saw... something within 
it shining back. Something terrible. 18  False Knight  A maggot driven 
mad by a strange force. Inhabits a stolen armoured shell. Weak creatures 
love to steal the streng th of others. Their lives are brief and fearful, 
and they yearn to have the power to dominate those who have dominated 
them. 19  Maggot  Weakest member of the kingdom of Hallownest. Generally 
looked down upon and forced to do menial labour. Consisting main ly of sweet fat, these helpless creatures make excellent provisions for long 
journeys. Best roasted over open flame. If they try to bargain for their 
life, just ignore them. They have nothing to offer. 20  Menderbug  Member 
of an elusive guild of bugs fixa ted on the maintenance of Hallownest's 
many signs and wayposts. The bugs of Hallownest were obsessed with 
building things. What strange little minds they had. 21  Lifeseed  Small 
scuttling seed filled with Lifeblood, which can be extracted and consumed 
for its healthful properties. The bright liquid inside of these little 
fellows is delicious, and drinking it will make you feel stronger. I 
wonder how my own innards taste... would it be a heinous thing to try and 
drink some? 22  Baldur  Rolls into a ball and  propels itself at intruders 
who wander into its territory. Aggressive even when newly born. Younger 
hunters delight in catching these creatures and rolling them around for 
sport. I encourage you to indulge yourself if the fancy strikes you. 23  
Elder Bald ur  Bulky and covered in thick plating. Retracts into itself 
when attacked. As they age, these creatures become too heavy and lumpy to 
roll around freely. Instead, they curl up and hide from the world. What 
do they think of in there, wrapped up inside of t hemselves? More carefree 
times perhaps. 24  Mosscreep  Weakling that covers itself in leaves to 
appear larger. Hides amongst the undergrowth. I used to think these 
things were merely ambling plants. When I learned they were actually 
living creatures, I beg an to kill them on sight. This is the nature of 
the Hunt! 25  Mossfly  Winged weakling that covers itself in leaves to 
appear larger. Hides amongst the undergrowth, fleeing if predators draw 
near. They spend their whole lives hiding or fleeing. How sad. Or , 
perhaps that is the life they choose for themselves and they enjoy it? 
It's a strange thought, but not impossible. 26  Mosskin  Plant -like bug 
that charges at foes when close. They can be hard to spot amongst the 
foliage until you get too close and they suddenly come charging at you. 
Tread carefully. 27  Volatile Mosskin  Plant -like bug swollen with 
infection. Releases deadly gas when threatened. The gas that seeps from 
their growths smells invitingly sweet, but it will burn through shell and 
flesh if you  get too close! 28  Fool Eater  Carnivorous plant that snaps 
at any creature that comes close. You really would have to be a fool to 
be tricked by a plant. 29  Squit  Charges at prey with its needle -like 
proboscis. When they lunge at you, don't panic. Stan d your ground, and 
strike back as they come close. 30  Obble  Fat, slow, flying bug. 
Frequently discharges the acidic liquid stored in its round body. Does it 
realise what a nuisance it is? Drifting around, spilling its noxious 
juices everywhere it goes? I f you see any, make sure to kill them. 31  
Gulka  Aggressive plant -life that retracts protectively when danger is 
near. Spits hard spikey balls when foes are at a distance. Its leaves are 
dry and bland. The bud is unpleasantly sour, but oh! The venom in th ose 
balls it spits. Exquisite! If you have the time to spare, try drinking 
some and enjoy the effects. 32  Maskfly  Harmless flying creature that 
favours serene environments. Usually travels in flocks. They all keep 
lookout for danger and when one flies aw ay the rest do as well. I wonder 
how it feels to have the protection of a pack? 33  Moss Charger  Timid 
creature that frightens away intruders by covering itself in huge clumps 
of moss. It's small, but it finds a lot of courage and strength once it 
covers itself in foliage. And I can understand the desire to camouflage 
oneself... 34  Massive Moss Charger  Family of creatures that have learnt 
to bulk up with moss and live as one. There is strength in numbers, yes, 
but these creatures never had much strength to begin with. Cut through their trickery. 35  Moss Knight  Protector of the Greenpath, trained in 
the ways of the Nail and the Shell. They hide as bush -like mounds and 
look soft, but beware these warriors! They are relentless in combat, 
fiercely guarding something hidden deep in the Greenpath. 36  Mossy 
Vagabond  Lazy, portly Mosskin. Easily swayed by others. Slow, fat and 
easily vanquished; common threads in those who forget their calling and 
forsake their duties. 37  Durandoo  Simple walking creature enc ased in a 
hard shell. Often found wading in shallow pools of acidic water. One of 
the few creatures that can survive in the rivers of harsh acidic water 
that flow around us. Where does this water come from? It bubbles and 
spits with a seething hatred of th e living... 38  Duranda  Simple flying 
creature protected by a spikey shell. Thinks itself fully protected and 
so is unconcerned by passers by. Attack its face, and teach it that 
nothing is ever safe. 39  Aluba  Passive glider that prefers to dwell 
near acid waters. What careless a life led drifting above us all. If one 
ever comes too close to the ground though... 40  Charged Lumafly  When 
threatened they cluster together, generating electricity. They usually 
drift about peacefully, but sometimes they clust er together and spit out 
a sharp, crackling flash that will stun and burn even large beasts like 
myself. Watch closely for an opening and move past them quickly. 41  Uoma  
Smallest Jelly form. Passive and unaware, but pulsing with a dangerous 
electric char ge. The spirit of a dead ancestor? The brain of a larger 
creature, allowed to drift free? An egg searching for a safe place to 
spawn? I have no idea what this is. 42  Ooma  Passive outer being 
protecting an aggressive, explosive core. Ghastly, eerie creatu re made 
out of a thick liquid. You can peer right through them, and can't see 
where they keep their thoughts. I don't trust them at all. Keep away. 43  
Uumuu  Intelligent being that guards the inner chamber of the Teacher's 
Archives. The canyon below us, t he one thick with fog and crackling with 
strange energy... a Hunter can lose their senses down there. Be 
careful... strange and unnatural things lurk there. 44  Ambloom  Simple -
minded crawling fungus. Its cap is covered in a layer of hardened spikes. 
Lie on your belly, open your maw and let this tasty morsel stroll 
straight into your stomach. 45  Fungling  Passive fungal balloon. 
Internal gasses cause it to float. Just a child, it drifts about with 
closed eyes and an open mind. When I was young, my brothers  and sisters 
and I would hunt each other in the nest. Now I hunt alone. 46  Fungoon  
Fully grown fungal balloon. Spits built up internal gas at aggressors. So 
round! I don't think I've seen a rounder creature than this. This world 
certainly hides some marv ellous creatures. I must hunt them all down! 47  
Sporg  Detects nearby movement and fires out explosive spores that drift 
towards their target. If you're skillful, you can lead their spores back 
to them and watch them perish in a destruction of their own m aking. There 
is a lesson in that, I think. 48  Fungified Husk  The remains of a bug, 
consumed by a fungus. Frequently releases clouds of thick, deadly gas. 
The bugs of Hallownest are so pathetic that being infected by poisonous 
fungi actually increases the ir chances of survival! They really are 
absurd creatures. 49  Shrumeling  Young fungal creature. Spends most of 
its time in the ground but can uproot and flee if it senses danger. Looks 
like an ordinary mushroom until you get close, then it pops out of the  
ground and starts scurrying around blindly. Very, very amusing. 50  
Shrumal Warrior  Fungal creature that attacks intruders to protect its 
young. Something queer in the air has caused these mushrooms to grow 
hearts, minds, and even faces! This means they now fear for their lives, like all other living creatures. 51  Shrumal Ogre  Huge fungal creature. 
Attacks by spitting corrosive venom and slamming its body into foes. Are 
these hulking things beasts or are they mushrooms? I cut one in half and 
peered insi de to find out, but could find no answers in its soft, 
stinking insides. 52  Mantis Youth  Member of a proud tribe, fiercely 
protective of its territory. Launches stinging attacks with its needle 
sharp abdomen. As it grows, it loses the ability to fly. Pas sage into 
adulthood is often celebrated, but as time goes by we realise what we 
have lost. 53  Mantis Warrior  Member of a proud tribe, fiercely 
protective of its territory. Launches savage attacks with bladed 
forelimbs. If you venture too deep into the fu ngal forests, these 
warriors will stand in your way. What is it they guard, deep at the 
bottom of their territory? 54  Mantis Lords  Leaders of the Mantis tribe 
and its finest warriors. They bear thin nail -lances and attack with 
blinding speed. The Mantis tribe and the bugs of old Hallownest had no 
love for each other. The Mantises outlived their rivals though, and their 
civilisation still stands. 55  Husk Sentry  Animated remains of a 
Hallownest Sentry. Still retains some memory of its former task. More 
skilled at combat than most bugs of Hallownest, they are nimble but 
lightly armoured. Keep the pressure on them. 56  Heavy Sentry  Animated 
remains of a large Hallownest Sentry. One of few in Hallownest strong 
enough to wield a greatnail. Surprisingly quick -witted for a corpse. It 
will try to catch you if you leap over it and can chase you if you flee. 
Enjoyable to hunt, but beware them in packs. 57  Winged Sentry  Flying 
sentry of Hallownest. Patrols the heights of the vast cavern in which the 
city was built . Dances through the air just out of reach until it spots 
an opening, then swoops in for a decisive strike. If you're confident, 
wait for it to come to you then counter -attack. 58  Lance Sentry  Winged 
Sentry of Hallownest equipped with a nail -lance. Charg es at threats or 
throws its lance from a distance. This devious foe will often keep its 
distance and try to pick you off with its thrown weapons. When it charges 
at you, leap up and strike it down. 59  Mistake  Once a highly 
intelligent bug, deformed by th e misuse of soul. These fools meddled with 
the soul of other creatures and lost their shape. Now they skulk through 
the shadows of their Sanctum like slugs, hoping their old brothers will 
build them new bodies. 60  Folly  Once a highly intelligent bug, inf lated 
by the misuse of soul. I've heard whispers that the secret these fools 
were searching for was immortality. To live forever... I've never heard 
of anything so obscene! 61  Soul Twister  Highly intelligent bug that 
uses arcane knowledge to twist soul i nto vicious spells. I have heard 
others talk about 'soul' but I do not understand what it actually is. I 
do know that freshly killed meat tastes best - is that because the 'soul' 
still clings to it? 62 Soul Warrior  Learned bug, wielding a refined 
pinblade . Enhances its combat prowess with harvested soul. Where these 
strange warriors go, whispers follow them. Not only are they skilled with 
a nail, they can also use some strange power to shift suddenly from place 
to place. Stay on guard. 63  Soul Master  Hea d of the Soul Sanctum. 
Hoarded soul hoping to stave off Hallownest's affliction, but eventually 
became intoxicated by its power. The bugs of Hallownest tried all kinds 
of tricks and rituals and prayers to rid themselves of the infection. But 
to no avail! P erhaps the infection came from somewhere deep inside of 
them that they could not escape. 64  Husk Dandy  Former member of 
Hallownest's high society. Limited offensive ability. It seems the 
weakest, greediest members of Hallownest were also the one who exer ted the most influence. Truly a Kingdom that was always destined for ruin. 65  
Cowardly Husk  Former member of Hallownest's high society. Although made 
aggressive by the force inside, old instincts still occasionally compel 
it to run from danger. The fearf ul, cowardly nature of these Hallownest 
bugs persists even after death! It almost feels shameful to chase and cut 
them down. 66  Gluttonous Husk  Former member of Hallownest's high 
society. Uses its corpulent body as a weapon. As these bugs became 
wealthie r they hunted less and consumed more, eventually taking on a 
grotesque shape not unlike over -ripe fruit. 67  Gorgeous Husk  Corpulent 
husk encrusted with a shining metal. Retains the instinct to hoard Geo. 
There is beauty in many things. Reflections of lig ht in water, the taste 
of freshly killed meat, the cry of a hatchling for its mother... I have 
never understood the lust for metals and stones though. 68  Great Husk 
Sentry  Animated remains of a Great Sentry, the most elite of the city's 
guards. Wields a greatnail and shell. Its powerful attacks cause heavy 
damage. An extremely rare thing, a bug of Hallownest that actually poses 
a threat. Watch them carefully, as they can lash out quickly with 
devastating strikes. 69  Watcher Knight  Discarded shell of a W atcher 
Knight, re -animated by a swarm of infected flies. When these silent 
warriors fall in battle, their bodies split open and strange bugs come 
flying out. I wonder, what will come flying out of me when I die? Will my 
hopes and fears drift away into the darkness? 70  The Collector  Dark 
figure locked inside the Tower of Love. Preserves Hallownest's creatures 
in glass jars with particular attention given to Grubs. A shadow that 
sometimes flits through the caverns, making strange noises to itself. 
I've neve r seen it clearly so I have no idea what type of creature it is. 
71  Belfly  Thin wings hide a highly volatile belly. Will give its own 
life to protect its territory. An angry creature with no regard for its 
own life. A creature without fear... can it trul y be called "prey"? 72  
Pilflip  Odd creature that adapts to changing situations by flipping over 
and using the limbs on the other side of its body. Adaptability is an 
important survival skill. If a problem seems insurmountable, try 
approaching it from a d ifferent angle. 73  Hwurmp  Tiny and placid but 
swells to enormous size when threatened. Extremely amusing creature. 74  
Bluggsac  Placid but putrid creature. Holds rancid eggs within its gut. 
Easily tracked down if you have a sense of smell. I strongly su ggest you 
do not eat its eggs. 75  Dung Defender (Boss)  Skilled combatant living 
at the heart of the Waterways. Assails intruders with balls of compacted 
dung. Fighting for 'honour', or for 'loyalty'... you may as well be 
fighting for dust. If you want to  kill, do it for your own sake. That is 
the nature of a true Hunter. 76  White Defender  Figure from a fondly 
remembered past. Reacts gallantly to defeat by becoming stronger. 77  
Flukefey  Youngest of its species. Its body is composed of teeth, wings 
and stomach. Seems to want to latch onto any living thing that comes by 
with its sharp little teeth. It will leave its cousins alone though, so 
it isn't completely mindless. 78  Flukemon  Worm -like creature that 
prefers damp, dark habitats. Dangerous, unpredic table foes that infest 
the pipes below Hallownest's capital. Even when it seems you've killed 
them, you need to stay on guard. 79  Flukemunga  Aged fluke, grown fat on 
the rich refuse found in the pipes below the capital. When predators are 
too successful the surplus food they eat becomes soft bulk wrapped around 
their bodies. Still, these creatures at least seem to make good use of 
their additional weight. 80  Flukemarm  An insatiable breeder. Has 
populated the Waterways with its kind. Its insides double a s a nest for young Flukefeys. The desire to breed, to leave behind a memory of 
ourselves in the shape of a child... it seems to be etched deep into the 
heart of every living creature. I too have felt the pull of that base 
instinct. 81  Shardmite  Feeds on crystal dust and uses crystallised 
spines to protect itself from danger. I don't find this creature 
particularly notable or interesting. It should learn to fly, or breathe 
flames, or sing hauntingly. Anything to justify its existence. 82  
Glimback  Slow, h ardy creature. The crystals that grow on its back 
provide extra protection from foes above. Large and well -protected, but 
slow and docile. The bugs of Hallownest used to force these creatures to 
carry around their carts and machines. 83  Crystal Hunter  Fi res shards 
of fast-growing crystal at intruders. Make their homes all the way up at 
the top of the world. Do they use the crystals willingly as weapons or 
are they merely hosts and the crystals parasites? 84  Crystal Crawler  
Discharges searing beams of li ght from the crystals on its back as it 
crawls around, seemingly unaware. These creatures look weak, but 
sometimes burning pillars of heat will burst out from the crystals they 
carry on their backs. Be wary, and time your strikes well! 85  Husk Miner  
Remains of a bug drawn to the Crystal Peak for its precious crystal. Its 
claw-pick now doubles as a fierce weapon. The bugs of Hallownest lusted 
after the strangest things in life. They would dig furtively through the 
dirt for stone, ore and in particular the crystals that grow at the top 
of the world. 86  Crystallised Husk  Remains of a bug who died amongst 
the crystals. Animated by a strange force, it attacks by firing beams of 
light from its crystallised arms. There is some strange power hidden in 
the crysta ls that grow up there in the peaks. They gleam and glow in the 
darkness, a bright point of searing heat in each one. They sing too, if 
you listen. Very softly... 87  Crystal Guardian  Heavyset miner of the 
Crystal Peak overcome by crystal growth. Can disch arge blazing beams of 
light from its crystallised limbs. How does the world look to this 
creature, gazing out from within its crystal prison? Does it see only 
light? Is that what drives it into a frenzy? 88  Furious Vengefly  
Vengefly whose body has been d istorted by continued infection. Highly 
aggressive. The infection that passes from creature to creature grants 
strength and courage, but it also seems to enslave the will. Would you 
make such a bargain? 89  Volatile Gruzzer  Gruzzer swollen with infection 
and primed to burst. Horrible goo and noxious gas has started leaking 
down from above. Is there a source of all this pestilence? If so, I 
haven't seen it. 90  Violent Husk  Maddened by massive infection. Charges 
at enemies with no thought for its own prese rvation. The bugs of 
Hallownest were twisted out of shape by that ancient sickness. First they 
fell into deep slumber, then they awoke with broken minds, and then their 
bodies started to deform... 91  Slobbering Husk  The body of a bug, 
completely consumed  by infection. Spits corrosive liquid. The infection 
that swept through Hallownest so long ago... they say that the harder you 
struggled against it, the more it consumed you 92  Dirtcarver  Swarming 
predator of the Deepnest. Burrows through the ground and bursts out to 
surprise prey. Springy and vicious, these hunters will try to overwhelm 
you with numbers in the dark, tight, twisting caverns they carve through 
the ground. Always be on your guard! 93  Carver Hatcher  Flying creature 
that fires out dirtcarve rs from its body when potential prey comes close. 
Are these creatures the mothers of the dirtcarvers? They appear only 
loosely related. But then how do the dirtcarvers get inside of the 
hatchers? A confusing situation. 94  Garpede  Giant burrower covered i n thick shell plates. Tirelessly travels the tunnels of the Deepnest. 
Monstrously strong, they shrug off any attacks you make on their thickly 
armoured bodies. Luckily, if you simply avoid their paths they'll leave 
you alone. 95  Corpse Creeper  Parasitic beast that controls the body of 
its host after the host's death. The beasts of this land have found 
plenty of ingenious hiding places, but none so clever as the body of 
another creature! If you happen on such a beast, rejoice! You've hunted 
two creatures a t once! 96  Deepling  Infant of the Deepnest. Scuttles 
about in the darkness, learning the layout of its home. The Deepnest is a 
dangerous place to hunt, but rewarding. Keep an eye out for weaker 
creatures you can pick off and eat. Keep your strength up in  the 
darkness. 97  Deephunter  Crawls along walls and roofs, spitting burning 
venom at anything that passes by. They can be hard to spot as they 
flitter in and out of the darkness. Watch for their glowing eyes. 98  
Little Weaver  Nimble spider that travers es its domain on thin strands of 
web. Often waits in ambush. They can appear from the darkness at any 
moment! They seem to fly through the air, dancing on invisible strings as 
they silently stalk prey. 99  Stalking Devout  Worshippers of Herrah the 
Beast. Shield themselves with hard plated foreclaws, then lash out 
suddenly to cut down prey. Powerful, well -armoured and fast, these are no 
mere beasts. Study their movements and watch carefully for an opening. 
100  Nosk  Mimics the shape of other creatures to l ure prey to its lair. 
In the deepest darkness, there are beasts who wear faces stolen from your 
memories and pluck at the strings in your heart. Know yourself, and stay 
strong. 101  Shadow Creeper  Found only in deep, dark places. Has never 
been observed t o eat or drink anything. This little creeper is weak and 
poses no threat, but something about it still unsettles me. The way it 
moves and the noises it make are... strange somehow. 102  Lesser Mawlek  
Attacks by spitting acid and slashing with foreclaws. I f you try to keep 
your distance it will spit sticky, burning globs of vile stomach juice. 
Move in quickly and strike decisively. 103  Mawlurk  Large, immobile 
creature. Wildly spits venom when intruders pass by. How did this foolish 
creature lose its legs? ! I suppose it's possible to lose anything, if you 
really try. 104  Brooding Mawlek  Ferocious but extremely social 
creature. Becomes aggressive if not able to mingle with its own kind. I 
hear this beast crying out sometimes as I prowl the caverns, althoug h 
I've never actually laid eyes on it. Who or what is it calling for? As 
far as I can tell, its voice is never answered. 105  Lightseed  A single -
celled organism, completely infected. Scurries about simple -mindedly. 
Strange air has been seeping down from a bove for years. Some of that air 
became liquid, and some of that liquid became flesh, and some of that 
flesh came to life. I don't know what to make of it. 106  Infected 
Balloon  Single cell of infection. Has a simple mind and can float using 
internal gass es. The infection creeping through the Kingdom's dead 
veins... does it have a mind? Does it produce soul? Is it truly alive? 
107  Broken Vessel  Shattered corpse, reanimated by infected parasites. 
The shape of this creature... I have seen something like it  before. More 
than once, perhaps. It looks a little like the bugs of Hallownest, but 
not quite the same. Where did these empty little wanderers come from? 108  
Boofly  Large, docile creature that peacefully buzzes around in the 
caverns of Kingdom's Edge. T oo slow to escape you and too large to hide 
from you. This prey will not challenge you, but sometimes it is good to 
take things easy. 109  Primal Aspid  Wilder, ancestral form of the Aspid. 
Once thought extinct, they have reappeared at the edges of the wor ld. These cruel foes will ambush you and relentlessly attack with their 
searing venom. How strange that their descendants are so weak. If I have 
children, I hope they will be stronger than me... 110  Hopper  Leaps at 
prey and uses its sharp proboscis to dr ain vital fluids. This hopping 
thief's belly is full of the blood it has stolen from other beasts. If 
you hold it above a fire, the belly will grow and grow until it explodes 
in a steaming shower of fluids. 111  Great Hopper  Leaps around the edge 
of the w orld, trying to crush prey beneath its body. A worthy foe, 
surprisingly nimble for its size. Either keep your distance, or try to 
dance between its hops and strike at its legs. 112  Grub Mimic  Assumes 
the shape of a harmless creature to lure prey. Luring an enemy close by 
pretending to be a weak little grub. Very cunning! Unfortunately for 
them, I eat these grubs as soon as I see them. 113  Hiveling  Smallest of 
the Hive's inhabitants. Carries out simple tasks. Weak, but hard -working 
and numerous. Their ha iry little bodies are filled with a thick, sweet, 
golden liquid. Good to keep a few on you for long hunts. 114  Hive 
Soldier  Defends the Hive against intruders with its extendable stinger. 
Savage and dedicated warriors. Be prepared to fight them to the de ath if 
you plan on invading their home. 115  Hive Guardian  Protects the Hive by 
hurling its huge body at intruders. Like their smaller kin, their only 
instinct is to protect the Hive at any cost to themselves. Somewhat 
clumsy, they'll often damage the str ucture of the Hive when charging at 
intruders. Does this cause them shame? I do not know whether they have 
the capacity for such a thing. 116  Husk Hive  Cowardly husk, its body 
colonised by hivelings. Did the hivelings build their nest around this 
sorry bug, or did the bug squeeze its body into their nest? Either way, 
they seem happy enough together. 117  Hive Knight  Loyal protector of the 
Hive's Queen. Flightless but ferocious in battle. Some creatures are born 
with duties and loyalties marked indelibly upon their minds. They are 
strong, but they are also slaves. 118  Spiny Husk  Overgrown with 
vegetation, it attacks by firing sharp spines from its body. The spines 
they fire seem to be mildly poisonous. Don't use them to clean between 
your fangs after eat ing! 119  Loodle  Inhabits the wilds beside the 
Queen's Gardens. Not aggressive in nature, but its wild bouncing 
behaviour can be dangerous. It seems like their energy is limitless! Do 
they ever stop to sleep, or eat, or love? 120  Mantis Petra  Lurks 
amongst foliage and attacks by flinging wind -scythes from a distance. 
They will harass you from afar, so get close and strike quickly. Their 
bodies are brittle and will easily fall to your nail. 121  Mantis Traitor  
Once a member of the Mantis tribe, now cast out and driven mad by 
infection. Belonging to a tribe, or not belonging. I don't really 
understand what the difference is, or how it works. I have no tribe of my 
own. 122  Traitor Lord  Deposed Lord of the Mantis tribe. Embraced the 
infection and turned ag ainst his sisters. I have felt that desire. The 
desire to take the infection into myself. To become stronger, more 
powerful... these thoughts haunt my dreams during the darkest times. A 
false hope, but it can burn so brilliantly in one's mind. 123  Sharp 
Baldur  Hardened baldur, bred for battle in the Colosseum of Fools. 
Tougher and more aggressive than its wild ancestor. These creatures... I 
have never seen one fully grown. I suppose they aren't allowed to live 
long enough to become adults. 124  Armoured S quit  Hardened squit, bred 
for battle in the Colosseum of Fools. Tougher and more aggressive than 
its wild ancestor. Strong and quick! When they rear back, either move out 
of the way or prepare to strike back! 125  Battle Obble  A Battle Obblewas raised in  the Colosseum. Although trained for combat, its 
movements and attacks are still haphazard. They have crafted a tiny mask 
for it! Is such an extravagance practical I wonder? 126  Oblobble  Larger 
cousin of the Obble. Pairs with a mate for life and will nev er leave its 
side. Having a mate by your side... one that will never leave you until 
death. Strange. No mate has ever come forth to stay by my side... 127 
Shielded Fool  Warrior fighting for glory in the Colosseum of Fools. 
Warily approaches opponents with  shield held high. That 'Colosseum' is a 
strange place where some bugs fight each other to the death and others 
watch. I don't understand such obscure rituals. If you venture in, stay 
on guard at all times. 128  Sturdy Fool  Warrior fighting for glory in 
the Colosseum of Fools. Uses crescent -shaped blades to cut down foes. You 
can hit this warrior's spinning weapons out of the air, straight back 
into them! Useful if they manage to corner you. 129  Winged Fool  Warrior 
fighting for glory in the Colosseum of Fools. Flies just out of an 
opponent's reach then darts in for the kill. What do they hope for, these 
warriors fighting in the Colosseum? Are they slaves, or prisoners, or do 
they freely choose to fight? 130  Heavy Fool  Warrior fighting for glory 
in the C olosseum of Fools. Aggressively charges down foes. Large, bulky, 
and fighting for its life. Don't underestimate this fighter! It can 
slither around quickly despite its bulk. It also has a surprisingly 
beautiful face beneath its mask. 131  Death Loodle  Loo dle equipped with 
a helmet and taught to kill. They seem fierce, but they have a lot of 
difficulty at aiming their target. Watch their motions and strike when 
the opportunity comes. Take their helmet with you as a trophy. 132  Volt 
Twister  Learned bug tha t adapted the teachings of the Soul Sanctum into 
a deadly fighting art. Attacks with bursts of electricity. Supposedly 
lives on a diet of lumaflies and spends its entire life fighting in the 
arena or meditating in seclusion. An odd foe. 133  God Tamer  Vet eran 
warrior of the Colosseum of Fools. Fights by the side of creatures it has 
trained. Some hunters train beasts to join them in chasing down prey. I 
tried it once, but couldn't resist the urge to test my companion's 
strength against mine. 134  Pale Lurke r  Forgotten champion of the 
Colosseum, drawn away by strange obsessions. This odd creature is 
unaffected by and unaware of the disease drifting through the caverns. 
Its madness is all its own. 135  Zote the Mighty (Boss)  A self -
proclaimed Knight, of no r enown. Wields a nail he carved from shellwood, 
named 'Life Ender.' Some rare creatures are so weak, so helpless, so 
inept and so irritating that hunting them gives no pleasure. 136  Grey 
Prince Zote  Figment of an obsessed mind. L acks grace but becomes 
stronger with every defeat. "My love, any creature who could bear to be 
away from you, who would willingly leave you behind or say unkind things 
to you... Pah! Lowly maggots, not worthy of standing in your glorious 
shadow!" She felt her cold body grow warm, a  sensation she had almost 
forgotten... - 'The Grey Prince' Chapter 112 137  Winged Zoteling  Figment 
of an obsessed mind. Grudgingly assists its master in combat by lazily 
flying towards foes. She asked whether he had bought the Charm for her as 
he promised  he would, but then he explained. The Charm was actually of 
low quality and not worth the price asked. She understood the wisdom of 
his decision perfectly. 'The Grey Prince' Chapter 136 138  Hopping 
Zoteling  Figment of an obsessed mind. Jumps about in a nonthreatening 
manner. "That lowly map -maker's wife? Hah! My Queen, how could you 
compare yourself to her? In the face of your intoxicating beauty, all 
other females are merely dust!" The Grey Prince trembled with anger and indignation... and love. 'The Grey Prince' Chapter 178 139  Volatile 
Zoteling  Figment of an obsessed mind. Deals poorly with the pressure of 
existing and quickly explodes. The Grey Prince was a wanderer by nature, 
but she could not bear to be separated from him. So she devised a plan t o 
make sure that she and her prince would be together always. She only had 
to wait for her chance. 'The Grey Prince' Chapter 205 140  Xero  
Lingering dream of a fallen warrior. Executed for crimes against the 
King. A life defined by tragedy and triumph. A  death marred by sorrow and 
regret. A spirit burdened by sins and memories. Better to wander the

Sage 155  Wingmould  A fly -like construct formed of white shell and a 
dark liquid interior. The bugs of Hallownest believed that their King 
created this world and everything in it. For what purpose, I wonder? Were 
his subjects companions, or toys, or children? Such a mind seems 
unknowable. 156  Royal Retainer  The most loyal and devout servants of

obeying a ruler. Such creatures become the arms and tee th and claws of 
their monarch. 157  Kingsmould  Guard construct of Hallownest's Palace

protects a fragile body. They say the old King died long ago, but his 
influence echoes around us sti ll. A creature like that... what did he 
desire? 158  Sibling  Fragment of a lingering will. Far down below us, 
beneath the kingdom, the air grows stiller and a sense of emptiness 
pervades. Can life flourish down there? If so, I will hunt it. 159  Void 
Tendrils  Fragments of void taking the shape of sharp, thrashing 
tendrils. The bugs of Hallownest sometimes wondered whether there were 
other, older, stranger Kingdoms deep below them. What strange fancies 
they had. That's probably why they were always so dist racted and easy to 
kill. 160 Hornet (Boss)  Skilled protector of Hallownest's ruins. Wields 
a needle and thread. I have seen this nimble little creature. I thought 
her prey and pounced at her, but with a flash she stabbed me with her 
flying stinger and dar ted away. Could she be... a Hunter? 161  Hollow 
Knight  Fully grown Vessel, carrying the plague's heart within its body. 
The old King of Hallownest... he must have been desperate to save his 
crumbling little world. The sacrifices he imposed on others... al l for 
nothing. 162  Pure Vessel  Chosen vessel, raised and trained to prime 
form. "Deepest silence in holy shell, Given nail and named a Knight, 
Bound by chain and egg and spell, Hear Our plea! Reveal thy Light!" 
Prayer to the Vessel 163  The Radiance  Th e light, forgotten. The 
plague, the infection, the madness that haunts the corpses of 
Hallownest... the light that screams out from the eyes of this dead 
Kingdom. What is the source? I suppose mere mortals like myself will 
never understand. 164  Shade  Ech o of a previous life. Defeat it to 
retake its power and become whole. Each of us leaves an imprint of 
something when we die. A stain on the world. I don't know how much longer 
this kingdom can bear the weight of so many past lives... 165  
Hunter'sMark  The  mark of a true Hunter. I have no offspring, nor 
subjects, nor worshippers. The sum of my being, my learning, my 
instincts... I leave it all to you. Good luck, Hunter. 166  Seal of 
Binding Intricate seal of ancient design. Used to contain a powerful 
force, or to preserve something of great importance. 167  Void Idol  Rare 
artifact from a time before Hallownest, its spires twined in a unified 
form. Contains a large amount of liquid from the Abyss, perfectly still. 
"Inspired or mad, those ancient bugs. They d evoted their worship to no 
lord, or power, or strength, but to the very darkness itself." Lemm 168  
Weathered Mask  Strange mask from a godless land, passed down over time. 
The design suggests the wearer's thoughts were focused through the crest. 
"Gods of  Thunder, Gods of Rain! Why forsake thy servants? Will Our minds 
be left suffering, to ache alone? What God remains to deliver Us from 
this woeful silence?" Lament of the Godseekers

StrategiesStrategy WriteupFailed Champion's attacks are similar to how 
you fought the False Knight, the only difference is that his attack rate, 
speed, health has increased exponentially and each attack youreceivedoes 
2 hit pointsworth  of damage. Regardless of that, you can still keep track 
of its movement. Since you won't be able to replenish SOUL from striking 
the Failed Champion, it is advisable to equip charms that can provide an 
increase of health or alter its effects. Charms such as Lifeblood Core, 
Joni's Blessingwill provide more Lifeblood Masks while Hivebloodmay be 
useful to regenerate health over time but can be tricky since you must 
not get hit while your health regenerates.Make sure to upgrade your nail 
as well before jumping  into this battle to increase its damage value. In 
conjunction with The Nail, pairing charms that will enhance The Knight's 
basic attacks will work for this battle such as Unbreakable Strength/

LocationForgotten CrossroadsGodhome (2nd encounter)False K night 
Rewards200City CrestFalse Knight StrategiesStrategy WriteupThe False 
Knight can be found at the centre of the Forgotten Crossroads, this boss 
is one of the first few bosses to encounter. The False Knight may seem a 
formidable foe, but do not get over whelmed by his appearance since his 
attacks at first are slow and can be avoided.We will assume that you have 
chosen to face this boss in the early stage of the game and that you do 
not have that many charms, spells and abilities - The False Knight has 
three phases, where at first it will have three basic attacks, a leaping 
attack, a basic overhead slam attack, and a slamming shockwave attack. 
Keep in mind that the leaping attack is in conjunction with the overhead 
slam attack where it can bait you into thi nking that it will only leap 
towards you. Always keep your distance or if you are close enough, try to 
dash or run towards the opposite direction and land a few strikes.The 
leap attack deals damage upon contact and can also follow up with 
slamming its mace  down which has a long reach, its third attack is a 
shockwave slam where The False Knight will slam the ground hard in place, releasing a shockwave that travels in a horizontal line towards The 
Knight - the only way to dodge this is to keep a distance and jump over 
the shockwave to avoid it.Once you have inflicted enough damage, The 
False Knight will stagger where it will fall flat onto its belly, and 
reveal its face. This is your window of opportunity to strike it as much 
as you can. However, right after t hat, it will recover and enter its 
second phase. The False Knight will follow up with a fast attack where it 
slams the ground in an overhead arc from left to right that deals damage 
upon contact - in addition, since it is now in a state of rage, the 
shockwave slam will also cause rocks to fall from the ceiling.The third 
phase will start after staggering The False Knight for the second time, 
it will start off similar to phase 2 where it slams its mace from left to 
right. However, for this phase, all attacks that consist of The False 
Knight slamming the ground with its mace will cause rocks to fall from 
the ceiling in random spots and gains an increase of speed.The battle 
will end where it leaps away and lands on the ground causing it to break 
and falls down. Follow where it falls to find it lying on its belly and 
the maggot's face springing out of the armour - continue striking it 
until it explodes which implies that the boss battle has ended. The False 
Knight drops200 and the City Crestupon exploding/defeat.A ttacks & 
CountersAttackCounterPhase 1False LeapThe False Knight will jump in the 
air towards The Knight's direction in order to close the gap or to follow 
up with slamming the ground with its mace. It is somehow a slow attack 
which allows you to watch its movement. So do not jump, be patient and 
wait for theopportunity to move around in case you are stuck in a sticky 
situation to avoid and keep your distance - deals damage upon 
contact.False SlamThis attack is a follow -up attack in conjunction with 
its leap ing attack, the False Knight slams its mace on the ground after 
landing on the ground. It has a long reach, so keep your distance or try 
to move to the opposite direction to avoid the attack - deals damage upon 
contact.Shockwave SlamThis attack is also in conjunction with the leap 
attack. The False Knight may perform a mix -up with its attacks, instead 
of just slamming the ground, the False Knight emits a shockwave 
createdafter slamming the ground with its mace. The shockwave runs in a 
horizontal line toward s The Knight's direction that deals damage upon 
contact.Phase 2First TantrumAfter staggering The False Knight, it 
recovers and throws a tantrum. After recovering, it will slam its mace 
from left to right in place - deals damage upon contact.Boulders from 
aboveIn its second phase, after The False Knight slams its mace on the 
ground for a shockwave slam attack, boulders from the ceiling will fall 
down. These rocks will fall in random positions and do not lock onto The 
Knight's position - deals damage upon con tact.Phase 3Second TantrumAfter 
staggering The False Knight for the second time, it recovers and throws 
another tantrum by swinging its mace from left to right in place. Apart 
from dealing damage upon contact, it will also cause rocks to fall down 
the ceil ing while slamming on the ground - in addition, all of its 
movement and attacks have increased speed.Boulders from aboveIn phase 
three, its regular slam attack along with the shockwave attack or any 
attack where The False Knight uses its mace to slam it on  the ground will 
cause rocks to fall from the ceiling in random spots.False Knight LoreThe 
False Knight is aMaggot - a small and largely defenceless creature 
regarded as prey by most other bugs. At some point the False Knight had 
stolen the armor of Hegemo l, one of the five knights of Hallownest, and 
now uses it to eliminate those who cross his path so he may protect the lives of his brethren. Later on, upon returning to the Forgotten 
Crossroads after defeating him, you will find two other maggo ts weeping 
over his corpse and referring to him as their brother. After battling him 
again in his dream formFailed Champion, his sorrowing ghost will rise and 
explain to the Knight that the only reason he stole Hegemol s armor and 
attacked others who came into his dom ain was to protect his family, the 
innocent maggots, who were being preyed upon by other bugs of 
Hallownest.The mace he uses (known as Macebug) is actually a strange 
armored bug with tiny skittering feet that is found nowhere else in game; 
it crawls away o nce you have defeated the False Knight.False Knight Notes 
& TriviaDefeating the False Knight unlocks the "Falsehood" 
Trophy/Achievement.In the first arena,after it falls down, you can obtain 
the Vengeful Spiritspell before jumping down and heading towards the next 
area instead.The head of the mace of the False Knight is revealed to be 
another bug (Macebug) that can be bounced around with The Nail - it 
squeaks and stops moving when struck. It cannot be killed and does not 
deal any damage to the Knight.Hittin g the corpse of the False Knight with 
the Dream Nailwill initiate another boss fight to face the Failed 
Champion.Similar to other projectiles in the game, the falling rocks in 
this fight can be knocked back to the boss, damaging him. Although it 
isn't nece ssary to defeat the boss, it can be used to shave a little bit 
of time off the fight.BossesBroken Vessel,Brooding Mawlek,Brothers Oro

 Flukemarm LocationRoyal WaterwaysHealth350RewardFlukenestFlukmarm is a 
Boss in H ollow Knight. Bosses are special Enemiesthat feature their own 
arena, a large amount of health, and a variety of unique moves and 
abilities.You will need to perform multiple attacks such as using The 
Nail and Nail Arts along with theSpells and Abilitiesin order to defeat 
them. Some bosses are capable of entering into a state of stagger after 
landing a number of attacks on them.As soon as you encounter a boss,its 
name will appear on the screen, the music will change into a boss battle 
theme, and usually, pat hsconnecting the arena will close or will be 
blocked leaving you no choice but to face these devastating and unique 
foes.An insatiable breeder. Has populated the Waterways with its kind. 
Its insides double as a nest for young Flukefeys.The desire to breed,  to 
leave behind a memory of ourselves in the shape of a child... it seems to 
be etched deep into the heart of every living creature. I too have felt 
the pull of that base instinct.Flukmarm LocationRoyal 
WaterwaysGodhome(Second Encounter)Flukmarm RewardsFl ukenestFlukmarm 
StrategiesStrategy WriteupThe Flukemarm is an optional boss fight. She 
can be found in the Royal Waterwayshanging in the middle of the arena. 
You will find her sleeping and passive. The battle starts once you strike 
her with The Nail.The Fl ukemarm has only one attack, and that is to spawn 
Flukefeys that will chase and attack you once they come out. Keep in mind 
that she always spawns two Flukefeys every 3 -4 seconds, up to a maximum 
of 6 Flukefeys.It is recommended to get rid of the Flukefeys  first. After 
that, get on top of the Flukemarm. Jump onto her and perform a few 
downward strikes before landing back onto a platform. And finally, make 
sure you do not fall into the water. You will not be able to attack, 
making you open for the Flukefeys. Charms: Since this is an optional boss, 
you can try to obtain the following recommended charms first that can 
help you win this battle. Thorns of Agony/Defender's Crest: either of 
these can be helpful in dealing with the Flukefeys. Grubsong: since you 
will frequently take damage, having this charm equipped will help you be consistent with using your spells. Speaking of Spells, Quick Focusis 
useful if you need a quicker rate of recovering your health.Spells and 
Abilities: Vengeful Spirit can be used on the b oss itself whileHowling 
Wraiths might give you a bit of breathing room from the Flukefeys. If 
you're going down this route, have the Shaman Stoneand Spell 
Twistercharms equipped in order to increase the overall effects of your 
spells.One last thing to reme mber is to make sure you upgrade The Nail by 
speaking to the Nailsmith. Similarly to The Collector fight, this one 
will go much easier if you can kill the Flukefeys in one hit.Attacks & 
CountersAttackCounterPhase 1Flukefey Spawn The Flukemarm spawns 
Flukefeysthat will attack you. She starts off with spawning two Flukefeys 
and keeps spawning them up to a maximum of 6. Kill the Flukefeys as 
quickly as possible. Don't fall in the water. Flukemarm LoreFlukemarm is 
the parasite mother and matriarch of all Flukes , including the Fluke 
Hermit. She uses her body as a nest for the Flukes. She and her children 
have succumbed to The Infection, causing them to become hostile to anyone 
who disturbs their slumber.Flukmarm Notes & TriviaFluke Hermitis an

Knight is one out of the 45 Charms that is found in the game. These 
charms are special items that provide The Knight buffs that will help 
with both traversing Hallown est and battling its foes. Charms require 
Notches and can only be equipped and unequipped while having The Knight 
sit on a bench.Flukenest Information"Living charm born in the gut of a 
Flukemarm."While the Flukenest Charm is equipped, it replaces the 
Vengeful Spirit fireball spell with summoning 9 flukes, and the Shade 
Soul spell with 16 flukes. Each fluke deals with 4 damage resulting in 
overall damage of 36, while 64 damage with the Shade Soul spell 
equipped.This charm provides The Knight with high damage  but at the 
expense of sacrificing the range and consistency of the attack.Flukenest

 Focus  Focus collected SOUL to repair your shell and heal damage.Str ike 
enemies to gather SOUL. FunctionHealingLocationStarting SpellFocusis a 
Spellin Hollow Knight.Spells are magical active skills that complement 
The Knight's offensive and defensive capabilities. Each Spell is powered 
by SOULand has a base cost of 33 requ ired to cast. Focus allows the 
Knight to recover lost health both in and out of combat.Hollow Knight 
Focus Spell Function & UsageTheFocus spell allows The Knight toregenerate 
lost health by consuminggathered SOULand is used by holding the 
Focus/Castbutton. Focus has a base healing rate of 1 Mask per 33 SOUL 
consumed.The spell has a start -up time of 0.25 seconds and takes ~1.14 
seconds to heal the first mask.The Knight can continually heal by 
maintaining hold of the Focus/Cast button as long as they have 33 o r more 
SOUL. Each subsequent tick of theFocus spell after the first takes ~0.89 
seconds, bypassing the start -up.Focus can be interrupted by getting hit 
while casting. When the Knight is interrupted during a Focus cast, any 
SOUL consumed is wasted, therefor e it is imperative that you wait until 
you have an opening before attempting to heal. Note that theBaldur 
ShellandCarefree Melodycharms do not protect the Knight from interruption 
during a Focus cast.Focus can still be used while at full health, wasting 
the SOUL used on the cast.Unlike the other Spellsin the Knight's 
arsenal,the SOULcost of Focusis not affected by the Spell Twistercharm. 
However, there are other charms that can affect this spell's efficacy. See the Modifierssection below.How to Obtain the F ocus Spell in Hollow 
KnightFocus is the default Spellavailable to The Knightfrom the very 
beginning of the game. There is a Lore Tablet in King's Passthat explains 
its usage but the spell can still be activated before coming across and 
interacting with the  tablet.Hollow Knight Focus Spell ModifiersTheFocus 
spell can be modified by equipping the following Charms:Quick Focus - 
Increases Focus speed by 33%.Deep Focus - Each tick ofFocus heals 2 Masks 
but increases cast time by 65%.Shape of Unn - Allows the Knight  to move 
while castingFocus.Joni's Blessing -Converts all Masks into Lifeblood 
Maskswhich prevents the Knight from healing withFocus.Spore Shroom - 
Releases a damaging cloud of spores around the Knight 
whencastingFocus.Baldur Shell - Prevents damage while c astingFocus. Note 
that this does not prevent spell interruption, which can still cause the 
Knight to waste SOUL, making the charm's usefulness questionable.Hollow

Take note that these fragile type charms break whenever you die, in the 
event that it bre aks, you can have it repaired by going back to Leg Eater 
in exchange for Geo.Once you're done, head back outside and head all the

an NPC will emerge from the grou nd, here you'll meet Cloth. Talk to her 
and she'll warn you about the danger that lies beyond the village. Enter 
the next section after talking to her and go all the way to the bottom 
part of the area where you'll see Hornetagain who will retreat towards 
the section to your right, you won't be able to reach her yet since you

Corniferat theForgotten Crossroads(which is below Dirtmouth) where he 
will sell you the map of the current area for30. How do I know if 
Cornifer is around or how do I find him? In order to track downCornifer, 
you'll find traces of paper scattered on the floor and you'll hear him 
humming. And if you miss the chance of finding him, you can always visit 
his wife, Iselda - which brings us to our next tip, 
visitingIselda.Iselda, your go -to MerchantIseldais a merchant located in 
Dirtmouth and is also the wife of Cornifer. As mentioned earlier, if you 
are unable to find Cornifer, you  can always visit Iselda to buy the map 
of a newly discovered area but only for a higher price of Geo. It is also 
recommended that you spendmost of your Geo on what Iselda offers in her 
shop since she carries the items that you need in the early part of th e 
game.Items likeMap Pinsthat markcertain points of interests of the game 
like Benches and Merchants, as well as the Quill that is a must -have item 
that will allow you to update certain areas of the map that Cornifer 
hasn't discovered. Iselda's shop opens after The Knight either speaks to 
Corniferordefeats the False Knight.The shopcan be foundin Dirtmouth, east 
of the Stag Station.Use the Bench,Always Rest and SaveEach time you 
discover a new area within Hallownest, make it a habit of always finding 
and using a Bench. A bench can be used for multiple things, such as a 
checkpoint, recovery of health, organizing and equipping Charms, and the 
most important mechanic, updating and filling in undiscoveredrooms and 
areas of the Mapthat you have visited.So it is im portant that you 
purchase the map pins from Iselda in order to have a detailed map that 
will definitely aid you in your traversal and your overall progress of 
the game, the Bench Pin allows The Knightto mark the location of a Bench 
that you've discovered, as long as he uses the Bench to update the 
map.Speak and Listen to EVERYONENow that you have the items needed to traverse the depths of Hallownest, you'll most likely encounter 
variousNPCsof the game - and it is recommended that you "listen" to them 
and make sure to run through their dialogues when you encounter one. 
These NPCs add morecontextand information that you will need to 
understand the story of the game, while other NPCs provide the player 
Quests that will reward you with unique items and even unlo cks trophies 
and/or achievements.Get CharmedCharms in Hollow Knight arespecial items 
that provide The Knight buffs that will aid you with your overall 
effectiveness of survivability and traversal in the game. As you progress 
through the game, you'll find, acquire, and even purchase different 
Charms - and this will give you the opportunity to craft and customize 
your own playstyle, whether it be an offensive, defensive, or a balanced 
set of Charms.How do I equip or change my Charms?Once you have acquired a 
new Charm or if you simply want to change your loadout, you need to rest 
on a Benchin order to swap out the Charm you want to use.The Nail is More 
Than a WeaponThe Nail is the primary weapon of The Knight and it is 
surprising of what the Nail is capable of doing -The Knight can attack in 
four directions and performing a down attack while in the air seems to be 
a combat mechanic one must master, performing an aerial down attack 
allows the Knight to "pogo" on top of an enemy or an environment that has 
spikes.U se the opportunity to learn how to attack in the four directions 
while on the ground and in the air since the enemies in the game consist 
of various ways of attacking The Knight - one more thing, the nail is 
also used to interact with levers or switches.Wh en it comes to combat, 
the Nail can be upgraded by the Nailsmith,the Nailsmith will require The 
Knight to provide him with sufficientGeoandPale Orein order to upgrade it 
- this will increase the damage done of melee attacks. And apart from 
that, to further  boost the capabilities of the Nail, you can find three 
Nailmastersaround Hallownestwho can teach you unique moves or techniques 
of the Nail. To learn more about the mechanics of the Nail, check our 
Nail and Nail Artspage.Use your Spells and AbilitiesSpell s and Abilities 
are skills that a player can acquire while progressing through the game. 
Take note that these spells consist of ways of recovering your health and 
also for executing powerful offensive attacks, while the abilities focus 
more withproviding a id with traversal.With this, it is recommended to 
have a balance of using both spells, abilities, and the Nail in order to 
have a chance of survivability and winning boss encounters - Hollow

 God Tamer LocationColosseum of FoolsHealth105 0RewardGeoGod Tamer is a 
Boss in Hollow Knight. Bosses are special Enemiesthat feature their own arena, a large amount of health, and a variety of unique moves and 
abilities.You will need to perform multiple attacks such as using The 
Nail and Nail Arts alo ng with theSpells and Abilitiesin order to defeat 
them. Some bosses are capable of entering into a state of stagger after 
landing a number of attacks on them.As soon as you encounter a boss,its 
name will appear on the screen, the music will change into a b oss battle 
theme, and usually, pathsconnecting the arena will close or will be 
blocked leaving you no choice but to face these devastating and unique 
foes.Veteran warrior of the Colosseum of Fools. Fights by the side of 
creatures it has trained.Some hunter s train beasts to join them in 
chasing down prey. I tried it once, but couldn't resist the urge to test 
my companion's strength against mine.God Tamer LocationColosseum of 
FoolsTrial of the Fool God Tamer RewardsGeoGod Tamer StrategiesStrategy 
WriteupThe G od Tamer is the last boss you will encounter at The Trial of 
the Fool in the Colosseum of Foolsso you will have to survive each wave 
until you reach these two. There are no checkpoints once you start the 
trial and if you die, you will have to start from th e beginning. So with 
this strategy, we will focus more on recommending which Charmsshould be 
equipped and why you should consider having it.Charms: The First charm 
isMark of Pride, this charm is essential since you will frequently need 
to keep your distanc e. Mark of Pride will allow you to increase therange 
of The Nail making it possible to land your attacks even from a distance. 
Quick Slash, in conjunction with Mark of Pride, having Quick Slash will 
be helpful since with the increased range of The Nail, pr oviding you with 
an increased speed of performing a basic attack will allow you to quickly 
dispose of the enemies and to restore SOUL easier. Quick Focus, you have 
the increased range, you have the increased speed of attacking, now let's 
make sure you have  this charm since it will increase the speed of using 
FOCUS to heal.Now you have your basic charms, let's focus on being 
defensive in battle. There are three types of charms that are useful for 
this trial, first is the Defender's Crest. While having this e quipped, 
The Knight will have a toxic gas surrounding it that inflicts damage upon 
contact. Thorns of Agony, you will definitely take damage in whichever 
wave you are in, so it is wise to have this equipped. Thorns of Agony 
will provide a counterattack eve ry time The Knight takes damage. With its 
quick reaction after taking damage, it is assured that you will land a 
hit with the thorns that emit from The Knight. And the last charm is 
Spore Shroom, inflicting chip damage whether it be big or small is 
important so having this charm is quite essential. Spore Shroom will 
allow The Knight to release a toxic spore cloud when using FOCUS that 
deals continuous damage upon contact for a short moment.If you choose to 
use your Spells more often in battle, having Shaman  Stoneand Spell 
Twisteris essential in order to increase the effectiveness of the damage 
dealt by spells and decreases the cost of using your Spells.With the 
following charms recommended, these will definitely help you survive the 
waves before reaching the  God Tamer. One important note to remember is to 
focus on defeating the Beast first instead of the Tamer to save you time 
and effort, since killing the beast first will cause the Tamer to stop 
fighting.Other than that, be sure you have enough Notches, Heal th Masks, 
a fully upgraded Nail and have acquired/upgraded your abilities in order 
to increase your survivability in this trial.Attacks & 
CountersAttackCounterTamerLeap AttackThe Tamer only has one attack where 
it will leap toward The Knight and will swing  its lance onto the ground 
after landing. This attack allows it to track The Knight and will only swing its lance at the last position where The Knight was standing before 
leaping.BeastThe Beast's CurlSimultaneously, with its Tamer leaping 
across the arena , the beast will curl into a ball, revealing its shell 
and will roll towards The Knight. No matter the distance, it will roll 
across the arena and will only stop until (1) it hits The Knight and (2) 
hits a wall, bounces off and lands back to the ground. Th e Beast is 
invulnerable to The Nail while it is curled up, however, you can bounce 
off its shell with a downward strike and spells can penetrate its armour 
that inflicts damage.Spit AttackThe Beast has a second attack where it 
will spit out a goo of infect ion that remains on the ground for a few 
seconds. These blobs travel in three groups, one being close to The 
Beast, the second in the middle, and the third shooting at the farthest 
from the two. Once it lands on the ground, it will remain for a few 
seconds that deal damage upon contact.God Tamer LoreLocated at the 
Colosseum of Fools, the God Tamer is the lastenemy you will face in the 
Trial of Fools after Wave 17. God Tamer is a veteran warrior who has 
trained its beast to become ferocious in battle making the duo formidable 
foes. They are considered to be the deadliest combatants in the arena, as 
well as the oldest who have been in the Colosseum.God Tamer Notes &

WalkthroughGetting to GodhomeBeforeentering Godhome, players will need to 
obtain the Dream Nail (see the page to learn more) and a Simple Key. You can purchase the key from Sly if you haven't done so already. 
Alternatively, there's a few of them hidden around the game, such as the 
one next to the Storerooms stag station in the City of Tears, or the one 
obtained from Pale Lurker (this one was added specifically with Godmaster 
update).Now head to the Royal Waterways and reach the Junk Pit: a  large 
trash-filled room in the south -west corner of the map. Here you will find 
a cocoon chained with a simple lock. This is the Godseeker. Use the 
Simple Key to free her. She will fall out of her cocoon, dropping the 
Godtuner. Pick it up; it will enable you to track how many Pantheons are 
open to you. Now use Dream Nail on the Godseeker. You will be sent into 
Godhome.The Hall Of Gods is the main sub -area of Godhome. There are 
benches and Hot Springs scattered around the area. Here you will find 
gates that  lead into the Pantheons as well as the monuments of each 
individual "god". You can enter the first Pantheon right away if you have 
previously beaten all of its bosses in the main game. You can also select 
a monument to challenge a specific boss in single combat. The monuments 
have three settings:Attuned: a regular match in a normal arena.Ascended: 
a match in an arena with additional obstacles, like smaller platforms or 
thorns covering the walls. Bosses have more health.Radiant: a match in a 
challenging are na, bosses have more health, and you have to beat the boss 
without taking any damage. Only available after you've beaten the 
Ascended version.PantheonsThere will be five Pantheons to complete for 
the Godmaster DLC. Upon entering each Pantheon you'll have t he option to 
select Bindings - a set of special conditions applied to all the fights 
in the Pantheon. These include:Nail Binding: lowers your Nail damage. For 
all Nail upgrades above Sharpened, the damage will be set to 13.Shell 
Binding: lowers your health  to 4 Masks. Does not affect Lifeblood 
Masks.Charm Binding: blocks you from using any Charms.SOUL Binding: your 
maximum SOUL is set to 33, the equivalent of one spell cast.Using 
Bindings is optional. You don't need them to complete Godmaster. However, 
if you do beat all the Pantheons with Bindings on, you will unlock a 
secret sub -area of Godhome called the Land of Storms, obtaining the 
Weathered Mask and some bonus lore.T he five Pantheons are as 
follows:Pantheon of the MasterPantheon of the ArtistPantheon o f the 
SagePantheon of the KnightPantheon of HallownestOnce you're in the main 
area, head to the second platform to reach a bench before heading to the 
Pantheons.Pantheon of the MasterSeek the Gods of Nail and Shell. Walk up 
to the first gate and enter the Pantheon of the Master, a Boss rush with 
10 matches (listed below). The rush ends with a new boss fight: 
Nailmasters Oro and Mato. Before the final fight, the Godseeker will 
address you with a short speech. Why hast thou crept into this pantheon, 
o meagre one? The noise of thine wriggling creates much discord, drowning 
out the godly resonances we attune Ourselves to. Dost thou mean to thwart 
our sacred goal? Dost envy drive thou to such madness? We pray that the 
Gods of this Kingdom punish thee, obliterate thee, utterly destroy 
thee!Vengefly KingGruz MotherFalse KnightMassive Moss 
ChargerHornetGorbDung DefenderSoul WarriorBrooding MawlekBrothers Oro and 
MatoClearing this Pantheon will unlock the Achievement: 
Brotherhood.Brothers Oro and MatoBrothers Oro and  Mato are the Final 
Bosses of the Pantheon of the Master. They are the former pupils of Sly 
and masters of Nail fighting.The first phase of their fight is a single 
combat with Oro. He has three attacks: Double Slash, Leap Attack, and his 
signature Nail Art : Dash Slash. This phase is quite straight -forward. 
Jump or dash to avoid his attacks and strike when you see a window. Just be careful of his Dash Slash, as this attack covers most of the arena. 
You can i -frame through it with a well -timed dash or Descend ing Dark.Oro 
has 500 health. After you've depleted it, Mato will join him for phase 2. 
This is where it gets tricky, Mato's two basic attacks are the same as 
Oro's, but he will also use his signature move Cyclone Slash. It has a 
shorter cooldown than Dash Slash, so you'll see it more often. Both 
brothers will also gain a defensive move, blocking your Nail attacks.They 
have a total of 1600 health combined and can be staggered. Most of their 
attacks have a short charging window; use it to dodge or strike. The  Nail 
Art attacks will charge for about a second. The Leap attack is also easy 
to track: similar to Hornet, they will pause in mid -air before falling 
upon you. Use this pause to dash away, then turn around and strike.If you 
have the Spell -boosting Charms e quipped, a fun tactic is to spam Shade 
Soul/Vengeful Spirit. Oro and Mato tend to stick together, so your spells 
will most likely hit both of them at once. Combine with Abyss 
Shriek/Howling Wraiths whenever they leap into the air and Descending

Inspiration.Paintmaster SheoSheo is the final boss in the Pantheon of the 
Artist. He is the former Nailmaster that taught you Great Slash.Similar 
to his fellow Nailmasters, Sheo need s to charge before releasing an 
attack. His animations have clear tells, which should make this fight 
easier once you've memorised them. Watch out for his signature move Great 
Slash and the Lunge Attack: both will reach you from across the 
arena.Sheo has 9 50 health and can be staggered. Heavy use of spells is 
recommended in this fight, as he likes to move around and execute ranged 
attacks. Shade Soul does a great job of countering Great Slash while 
Abyss Shriek will help with the Leap - an attack during whi ch Sheo leaps 
into the air and splashes you with red paint. Besides Shaman Stone and 
Spell Twister, you might want to use Soul Catcher or other SOUL -acquiring 
Charm, as this fight may drag on.Winning this fight will display your 
trial time and grant "Inspi ration" Achievement.Pantheon of the SageBelow 
are the enemies you will face before encountering this Pantheon's final 
boss, Great Nailsage Sly. As you begin the final fight, the Goodseeker 
will appear with following dialogue: Thou art painfully persistent!  Why 
dost thou defile this pantheon with thine presence? Seek ye glory, o vain 
one? Thou misunderstand Our purpose. Through ritual combat are We attuned 
to the voices of the Gods. Ever higher do they lead Us! Higher and higher

Great Nailsage Sly Clearing this Pantheon will unlock the Achievement: 
Focus.Great Nailsage SlyThe Great Nailsage Sly is the former tutor of the 
three Nailmasters and a legendary Nail wielder. He's a very tough boss. 
He has 1050 health and can be staggered. He's faster and more agile than 
his three pupils, and has shorter cooldown t imes between moves. It's 
recommended to use buffing Charms for higher damage output.Charms: Quick 
Focus is a must since Sly will only give you small windows to recover 
your health. Maintaining a safe space between you and Sly will be 
important, so make sur e to have Mark of Pride or Longnail to increase 
your strike range. Quick Slash is also helpful for dealing damage 
quicker. Combine any number of these with Shaman Stone, Spell Twister and 
Soul Catcher or other SOUL -acquiring Charm of your choice to be dead ly 
with both Nail and Spell.Spells: Shade Soul/Vengeful Spirit will come in 
handy in a variety of ways due to their fast casting speed. Just be sure 
to judge your distance, as the spell will lock you in place for a split 
moment and make you vulnerable to S ly's long -reaching attacks. Abyss 
Shriek and Descending Dark are not recommended since Sly constantly 
dances around the arena and you'll most likely miss, but their i -frame 
windows could help you with his second phase.He will use all three Nail 
Arts in his  first phase. Keep your distance at all times, use long -range 
attacks, take your time, and use the opportunity to strike Sly whenever 
he falls onto the ground after performing an aerial attack.Winning this 
fight will display your trial time and grant "Focu s" Achievement.    
Pantheon of the KnightThis is the fourth out of five Pantheons available 
in Godhome. It is only accessible after beating the previous 3. There 
will be a tower after the three gates where the gate to the Pantheon of 
the Knight will be. Th is Pantheon ends with Pure Vessel, a stronger 
version of Hollow Knight. As before, the Godseeker will appear and speak 
with you at the start of the final fight.Show reverence, o meagre one. 
Show fear! Thou approacheth a great and terrible God. Though its w orldly 
body be bound and defiled, the glory of its pure form endures, ruler of 
this pantheon. Its endless power shall attune Us to the one greater 
still, a God of Gods! Meagre on, dost thou imagine thyself the equil of 
this God? Dost thou imagine thyself m ade in its image? Thou assume a 
similar shape, and the deep echo within thee seems familiar  Ahh! What 
thoughts are these? Thou sow blasphemies in Our mind, wretch! Begone! We 
pray that the God of nothingness silence thee forever!Enraged Guardian

Failed ChampionMarkothWatcher KnightSoul TyrantPure VesselClearing this 
Patheon will unlock theAchievement:Soul & Shade.Pure VesselPure Vessel is 
a more powerful form of the main game's final boss , Hollow Knight. The 
Pure Vessel represents the time when Hollow Knight was in its prime, 
unweakened by the Infection. Despite being technically the same boss, 
Pure Vessel has a different moveset. Its attacks deal two Masks of damage 
on each hit. It has 16 00 health and can be staggered.The movement of this 
boss can be difficult to telegraph because it teleports around the arena. 
It chains a few attacks together before pausing for a short time. You 
will likely spend a few rounds practicing before you can con fidently face 
this fight. Learn to dodge every attack, then decide which openings are 
safe for counters. For these reasons you might want to play defensively 
at first and use Charms that buff your movement, healing and defensive 
capabilities, such as Dashm aster and Quick Focus.The safest healing window is the Pure Vessel's stagger animation and (with correct 
positioning) the one where it spawns spikes from the floor, but don't 
expect to heal more than 1 or 2 Masks at a time. This is also a good 
place to get  in a few hits or a spell. Shade Soul is particularly 
effective due to its high cast speed.Clearing this battle will reveal 
your trial time and grant "Soul & Shade" Achievement. Completing the 
fourth pantheon will allow players to gain access to the spade,  opening 
up another area. Head up to reach hot springs and another opening. Jump 
to reach the last pantheon.Pantheon of HallownestThis is the final 
pantheon out offive Pantheons available in Godhome. It is only accessible 
after beating the previous 4. This  time you will be facing 42 bosses.

ending. It has the same moveset, but its pace is quicker, and it has 2181 
health. It cannot be staggered; you will only get respite as it passes 
from one stage into another. This fight is brutal, and it's recommended 
to practice thorough ly on the main game version (there is no Radiance 
statue in the Hall of Gods, so the only way to practice is to load a save 
where you've reached the Dream No More ending).EndingsThere will be two 
possible endings to the Godmaster DLC (see Endings for more information). 
One is unlocked by completing all five pantheons; the other is unlocked 
by beating them after you've given the Delicate Flower to Godseeker. As 
you give her the Flower, she will say:An offering? Yes. The Crawler makes 
an offering to Us. Rare bloom, tiny and pure. No God, though. No 
godliness. But Still  What does Crawler as for in return? To touch? Our 
thick, gleaming hide? See the exquisiteface beneath Our mask? Such

the God of Gods!" - Prayer to the SageGreat Nailsage Sly 
LocationGodhomePantheon of the Sage Great Nailsage Sly RewardsRewards 
??Great Nailsage Sly Strat egiesStrategy WriteupThe Great Nailsage Sly is 
quite a difficult and tricky boss. Compared to the others, he is faster 
and has a shorter recovery rate of executing one attack after the other. 
Sly can be fought in Godhomeand appear as the final boss in the Pantheon 
of the Sage. It is recommended that you rely on your Spells or Charms 
that provide long -range effects or buffs. So first, let's talk about the Charms.Quick Focus is a must to have equipped since Sly will not stop and 
will only give you little time  or an opportunity to recover your health. 
So having this charm can help you recover health at a faster rate. 
Maintaining a safe space between you and Sly will be important, so in 
conjunction with that, make sure to have Mark of Prideto increase the 
range of the Nail allowing you to strike and be safe from a distance. 
Quick Slashis also helpful so that you can strike at even a faster 
rate.Spells, Shade Soulor Vengeful Spiritwill most likely work here, 
Abyss Shriek or Descending Dark isn't recommended since Sly constantly 
dances around the arena and you'll most likely miss. The reason why Shade 
Soul or Vengeful Spirit can work since it can be executed fast and can 
guarantee that it will hit Sly. But of course, if you plan on using your 
spells more often than The Nail, you must have the following charms 
equipped that can buff the overall effectiveness of your Spells - Shaman 
Stone to increase the effect of the spells, Spell Twisterto reduce the 
SOUL required whenever you cast a spell, and Soul Catcher or Soul E aterto 
increase the amount of SOUL gained from striking the enemy with The 
Nail.Keep your distance at all times, use long -range attacks, take your 
time, and use the opportunity to strike Sly whenever he falls onto the 
ground after performing an aerial atta ck.Attacks & 
CountersAttackCounterPhase 1Triple AttackSly will swing his nail twice 
and follow up with an aerial spinning attack. He will only spin in the 
air if The Knight is close to him. You will need to keep your distance 
when he swings his nail twice and be mindful to not jump afterward. When 
he finishes the third attack, you can take the opportunity to land a few 
strikes while he falls back onto the ground.Nailsage's SlamSly will first 
jump into the air and immediately follow up with slamming onto the  
ground. You can avoid the attack by dashing away and following up with a 
spell such as Shade Soulsince Sly will be briefly vulnerable after he 
performs this attackGreat SlashSly will execute theNail Art, Great Slash. 
Sly telegraphs this attack in place so  be careful to not get too close 
since a column of energy is released after Sly swings his Nail. You can 
either keep your distance and use your ranged Spells or time your dash 
right to phase through Sly and attack him from behind.Dash SlashSly will 
execute the Nail Art,Dash Slash. For this attack, Sly will jump away from 
The Knight and follow up with a Dash Slash which covers mostly the arena. 
You can either jump high to avoid the attack or phase through Sly and 
follow up with striking him with The Nail or executing a spell.Cyclone 
SlashSly will execute the Nail Art, CycloneSlash. Sly will spin around in 
the air for a brief moment and land back on the ground. You can avoid 
this by jumping above the attack and pogo off the attack to evade. If you 
get cornered , you can climb the wall and pogo off Sly.Phase 2Frenzied 
StateOnce you've dealt enough damage, Sly will enter a frenzied state 
which grants him improved movement speed. Sly jumps around the arena and 
bounces off walls for about 3 -4 times before actually s topping midair and 
spin like a saw blade. Usually, Sly will stop midair close enough to The 
Knight to try and deal damage, you can actually land a few strikes while 
moves around the arena, and once he stops midair, try to dash away and 
follow-up with a lon g range spell.Great Nailsage Sly LoreSly is first 
found at the Forgotten Crossroadsfighting off The Infection. We are able 
to save him if we find him and later opens his shop in Dirtmouthwhere he 
appears to be a normal citizen who is just running a busines s. As the 
story progresses, The Knight eventually meets the three Nailmasters and 
learns the legendary Nail Arts, it is later on revealed that Sly is the Great Nailsage who stood as a mentor and parent figure to the Nailmasters 
Oro, Mato, and Sheo. He can only be fought in Godhome where he sits on 
top of the throne in thePantheon of the Sage.Great Nailsage Sly Notes &

LumaflyGreenpath WalkthroughFinding CorniferPlayers will arrive at a 
heavily vegetated location called Greenpath. Her e, you'll encounter a new 
type of leafy enemies and paths that are filled with pools of acid. From 
the entrance, you'll want to head west where you'll encounter an Elder 
Baldurblocking your path. Just like your first encounter at the Ancestral 
Mound, you'l l need to use Vengeful Spiritto kill the beast. As soon as 
you are able to pass through, take your time and be careful as you try to 
jump on the small elevated platforms that are above a pool of acid - make 
your way to the lower left -hand side of the area and make your way back 
up to the next section which is also to your left.You'll now find yourself respectively in Greenpath, continue heading west by jumping onto 
the platforms where you'll encounter a new enemy a Volatile Mosskin. Be 
mindful since upon hi tting it the 2nd time, it will release a toxic cloud 
that deals damage upon contact, and upon killing it, make sure to keep 
your distance since its body will explode after a second which also deals 
damage if you are caught within its blast. There will also  be a 
Mosscreepthat crawls on walls, ceilings, and floors which make them hard 
to spot since their bodies are covered in leaves allowing them to 
camouflage.Continue heading west, and right before you reach the next 
section next to a gazebo -like structure, you'll find a secret path which 
you can jump up to where you'll find a cache of Geo. Be mindful and look 
at the floor to find sharp teeth emerging from the ground, walk in the 
middle to bait the Fool Eaterto reveal itself, once it closes its mouth 
you can hit it a few times before it re -opens it's mouth and burrows back 
into the ground. Repeat the method until you kill it, once you've cleared 
it, collect the geo from the cache and proceed to the next section to 
your left.Once you're inside the room, head to  the top part of the room 
to find a Bench you can rest on. When you're done resting, head down one 
level to your left where you can find another cache of Geo hidden just on 
the ceiling. Collect the Geo and continue into the next section to your 
left.As you  continue down the path, you'll briefly see Hornetat the top 
left corner, she'll immediately retreat into the section next to her once 
she sees you. Since you won't be able to reach the area as of the moment, 
you'll have to head to the bottom part of the r oom. Before heading all 
the way down, you'll want to head right at the middle section where 
you'll find a pool of acid and a Squit, this enemy is quite aggressive as 
it will charge to attack you once it sees you. Just pass it you'll find 
another cache of G eo, collect it and continue going down.Be sure to 
always look down before jumping down to find the elevated platforms since 
at the very bottom is yet another pool of acid. Once you've reached the 
bottom platform, you'll want to head counterclockwise toward s another 
cluster of Geo that you can find. After collecting the Geo, head back 
down and proceed into the next section to your right.From here you'll 
want to continue heading east until you reach the elevated platforms 
where you'll find a trail of paper. F ollow it and you'll eventually hear 
and find him - talk to Corniferand purchase a copy of the map of 
Greenpath for 60 Geo.The Path leading to The HunterAfter obtaining the 
map, walk to the left and cross the spiked pit and drop down into the 
next section. From here continue going to the left where a Mosscreepwill 
pop out, kill it and continue forward. Jump onto the platform that is 
held by a vine then wait for the 2x Mosskinto walk underneath the 
platform before cutting the vine to kill them both. Now, proc eed to the 
right where you'll find a path that has teeth -like structures emerging 
from the ceiling and floor - follow the path that will take you to The 
Hunter.Once you approach it, The Hunter will release a shriek. Regardless 
of it doing so, The Hunter is  non-hostile. Simple approach it and talk to 
it. Listen to it and it will provide you with The Hunter's Journalwhich 
gives you details of all the enemiesand bossesyou've encountered.Rescue 
Another GrubAfter collecting the journal, head back outside and cut  the 
vine that is holding the platform. Drop down to where the platform landed 
and continue on the 2nd platform with the vine, cut it and proceed to the 
3rd platform, and cut the vine again where you'll now land on a pool of 
acid. You'll now be able to rea ch a trapped Grub on the right -hand side 
of the area - break the jar to free the little critter.Exploring GreenpathUpon freeing the Grub, jump back on the platform and head west 
until you reach the next section. Just be careful since you'll encounter 
2x Squit. Once you've entered the section,Hornetwill appear and she'll 
swing away from you. You can drop down and into a bottom exit where you 
can find a Bench for you to rest and save your game. When you're done, 
head back up and follow Hornetto the top left -hand side. Just below the 
entrance leading to where Hornet went into, you can find another cache of 
Geo just below it. Just be careful since there is another Fool Eaterthat 
is hard to spot burrowed into the ground. Make sure to bait it and kill 
it first bef ore trying to get the cache of Geo. Collect the Geo and head 
back to the top and proceed into the next section.Continue heading left 
where you'll encounter about 3x Moss Charger. After killing the Moss 
Charger at the farther left -hand side, you'll see Horn etagain. Follow her 
into the next section and you'll find her again just above you. Again 
follow her until you reach the top exit.From here, you'll need to head 
up. But before doing that, head to the left where you can find a cache of 
Geo. Collect the geo and continue heading to the top where you'll find a 
Toll Machine to your left and a Bench to your right. Pay 50 Geo at the 
toll machine to open the gates. Now, make your way to the top until you 
reach the exit. Just be careful since you'll encounter Obble,  Volatile 
Mosskin, and Mosskin.Once you've reached the next section, head to your 
right where you'll enter an arena and face a Moss Knight. You'll need to 
defeat it in order for the gates to re -open. After defeating it, exit to 
the east and then head west and up to the top towards the next 
section.Boss Battle, Vengefly King.From here, head left where you'll 
encounter more Tiktik, Crawlidand Vengefly. Upon continuing left, you'll 
here someone that seems to be screaming for help, head up to the middle 
platform to find a bug named Zote the Mightywho is about to be eaten by a 
Vengefly King - strike thecreature with your nail to save Zote and the 
boss battle will begin.Vengefly King is considered as a mini -boss and an 
optional one. If you choose to ignore saving Z ote, he will not appear 
later on at the Colosseum of Fools and in Dirtmouth. So be sure to save 
first. Now the Vengefly King only has 2 types of attacks, one is he emits 
a loud battle cry where it will call out about 1 up to 2 Vengeflyand a 
charge attack w here it will fly towards your direction. You can click 
hereto check the strategies on how to defeat it - Vengefly King drops Geo 
upon defeat.After you've defeated the creature, Zote will recover. Speak 
to him and he will introduce himself - you'll find him  later on in 
Dirtmouth.Rescue a GrubWhen you're done talking to Zote, continue going 
left and drop down into the next section. Head east where you'll 
encounter 2x Moss Charger, and at the end, you'll find a secret passage 
that will lead you to a tablet for  you to read. From here, you'll hear a 
cry of a Grub, look down where you'll find it behind a locked gate that 
is being guarded by a Moss Knight - head towards its location, defeat the 
Moss Knight to unlock the gate and break the jar to free the Grub.Unlock  
the Stag StationUpon rescuing the Grub, you're goal now is to find and 
follow Hornet (Boss). But first, we'll try to find the Stag Station. 
Proceed to the left, and drop down to the bottom part, you'll see a Stag 
Station sign to your right which is pointi ng down to the bottom exit. 
Head down and then go left into the section where you'll find the Stag 
Station.Here, you'll find a Benchfor you to rest on and save your game, 
and next to it is a Toll Machine. Approach the Toll Machine and pay 140 
Geo to open u p the station for Greenpath, if you need to head back to 
Dirtmouth to purchase some Charms, simply ring the bell to call out The Last Stag.Acquire the Wanderer's JournalOnce you're done, head back 
outside the station and jump up onto the 2nd elevated platf orm, above the 
station sign. Now, there is a breakable wall that has a secret room which 
is at the right -hand side corner from the 2nd platform you are on, so 
you'll need to jump towards the wall and strike it with your nail a few 
times to destroy it.Upon breaking the wall, you'll find a secret room 
with a corpse of a bug that seems to be holding an item. Before picking 
it up, make sure to walk up to it and then jump on the other platform to 
avoid taking damage from a Fool Eater, kill it and then pick up th e item 
which is the Wanderer's Journal - this is a tradable item that can be 
exchanged for Geo.Boss Battle,HornetAfter acquiring the journal, head 
back up into the previous section that you passed then proceedwest and 
towards the next section which is also located to your left. You'll find 
yourself in a long corridor that will lead you to Hornet's arena, drop 
down and a short dialogue will begin - the battle will begin once she is 
done talking.Hornet is one of the quickest bosses you'll encounter, so 
you'll need to be patient and try to track her movement before you attack 
since you don't have that many Charmsequipped yet as well as a few Health 
Masks. However, it is best that you have the Soul Catchercharm equipped 
so that you can regain more SOUL whenever y ou hit her with your weapon 
and also take advantage of using the Vengeful Spiritspell when you have 
the opportunity. You can click hereto check the strategies on how to 
defeat her. Once she is defeated she will retreat, the gate to your left 
will open, and  she will leave behind the Mothwing Cloakability that you 
can obtain. With the Mothwing Cloak on, The Knight will acquire the 
ability to dash which will allow you to traverse areas you couldn't reach 
or otherwise can be used as an escape mechanic to avoid enemy attacks - a 
short scene will then follow if you jump in the middle of the arena.Once 
you've regained control of The Knight, head down where you'll see a 
puddle of acid, with the Mothwing Cloak you can dash over it to avoid 
getting hit. Once you've cr ossed it, look to the top right to find a 
cache of Geo, jump and then dash again to reach it.Upon collecting the 
Geo, head down and go left towards the path that will take you to a sub -
area the Lake of Unn. You'll encounter a small house where you can find  a 
bench you can rest and save your game, you'll also find another NPC named 
Quirrelwho is resting.Obtain the Thorns of AgonyWhen you're done resting, 
check your map and head towards the center area of the map and head 
towards the section where you encount ered structures that are covered in 
thorns and an enemy that looked like electric bugs. To reach the point 
where the charm is, you'll have to jump and dash in between the thorns 
and the Charged Lumaflytowards the eastern end of the section. There 
you'll fi nd the Thorns of Agony charm.The Path to the Massive Moss 
ChargerUpon collecting the charm, open your map and head to the lower 
area of Greenpath where you'll come across a path that has a new enemy, a 
Gulka. These enemies, spring out from the ceiling or w all where it shoots 
out a green ball, hitting it with The Nail will cause it to boomerang 
back to the enemy which deals damage to it. Continue following the path 
until you come across a ledge that has a section to the left which was 
too far for The Knight to reach earlier, now you have the Mothwing Cloak 
you can jump and dash to reach it.Once you've entered the section, head 
down and approach thehuge moss to start the battle with the Massive Moss 
Charger. You can click hereto learn more about the strategies  on how to 
defeat it - the boss drops Geo upon defeat. From there, head left where 
you'll find the entrance to the next section and right below it is a cache of Geo.Free the GrubWhen you're in, you'll have to jump up to go 
around and then head to the botto m elevated platforms where you'll find 
another pool of acid that has a Durandoowalking in it. You'll want to 
head to your left into the next section, but first, head to the right and 
just a little above it you'll find 2 clusters of Geo. Collect the Geo and  
then head into the next section to your left.In this section, you'll find 
4x Durandooyet walking in the pool of acid. You'll need to proceed west 
where the Grub is, and in order to reach it, you can cross the pool of 
acid by jumping on the Durandoo and th en execute a downward slash to pogo 
off its shell. If you've crossed the area using the 2nd Durandoo, you can 
jump up to the elevated platforms first towards the top right to find a 
chest with Geo in it.When you're done, head back down to find the 3rd and 
4th Durandoo, use the same method to cross the pool of acid until you 
reach the surface at the end. From there, jump on the elevated platforms 
thatare leading to the top right -hand side to find the trapped Grub - 
destroy the jar to free the little critter.  The path on your left won't 
be accessible at the moment since you'll need the Mantis Clawability to 
climb up walls.For now, retrace your course and make your way back to the 
Stag Station and fast travel back to the Forgotten Crossroads.Meeting 
Charm Lover  SalubraUpon arriving in the Forgotten Crossroads, head back 
to the path where you rescued Slywhich is near the arena where you fought 
the Gruz Mother. Since you have the Mothwing Cloak, you are now able to 
reach Charm Lover Salubra's shop where she sells charms and notches. 
After you're done checking her shop, you can visit the Grubfatherto 
obtain the rewards from rescuing the Grubs and then back to Dirtmouthto

Zote StrategiesStrategy WriteupTo win the battle against the Grey Prince, 
you'll need to finish the battle as quickly as possible and this is where 
heavy damage output charmsw ill work. Having a combination of Quick Slash, 
Mark of Prideand Fragile Strength/Unbreakable Strengthwill be useful here 
since you'll be able to maximize the damage that is dealt with just The 
Nail - just be sure that you upgrade your nail by visiting the 
Nailsmith.Spells will also be helpful here since you want to have the versatility to attack both in a close and long -range situation. With that 
said, it is also recommended to have theSpell Twisterand Shaman 
Stonecharms equipped to maximize the overall eff ectiveness of the 
spells.For abilities, before heading into battle, make sure you have 
acquired the Shade Cloakability as well as the Monarch Wings. Having the 
Shade Cloakability will save you from getting hit by the shockwaves since 
you can phase through it if you are caught in a sticky situation. Monarch 
Wings, on the other hand, will allow you to dance around the arena to 
avoid his attacks.Grey Prince Zote has some moments where he is 
vulnerable to getting hit, such as when he starts to spit out the 
Zotelings, you can use that opportunity to land a few attacks as well as 
when he trips over when he starts to run and swing his weapon towards The 
Knight - patience, and precision is needed in order to win this 
battle.Attacks & CountersAttackCounterPhase 1Flai l AttackCan be avoided 
if you jump over him or dash through with the Shade Cloak and then wait 
for him to get tired where he'll fall onto the ground releasing 
shockwaves. Once he's on the ground you can attack.Slam AttackCan be 
avoided if you jump over the  shockwaves or dash through it with Shade 
Cloak.ZotelingsZote spits out either a winged or spider -like bug that has 
Zote's head. You can quickly kill it in a group by using your 
spells.ShadowPoundSince he disappears for a brief moment before slamming 
onto the ground, it is best to avoid it if you have the Shade Cloakready 
so that you can quickly dash away from his landing spot and then execute 
a double jump to avoid getting hit by the shockwaves.Grey Prince Zote 
LoreGrey Prince Zote is a hidden boss in  Hollow Knight. He is the 
empowered dream variation of Zote the Mightythat was created by Bretta's 
reimagination of him. Not only is Grey Prince Zote very physically 
powerful, he also displays knightly chivalry, hence his utmost loyalty 
toward Bretta, as she im agines herself to be his queen.Grey Prince

Knight, The Grimm Troupe. They are giraffe -necked weevils, beetles with 
extraordinarily long necks  (the same species as Willoh, only with 
Grimmkin markings). Two Grimmsteedsare loyal members of The Grimm 
Troupe.Grimmsteed InformationThe Grimmsteedsdo not have known names and 
do not talk. They are quiet and contemplative as they sit peacefully 
together just outside of Grimm s tent. However, they are very 
intelligent, as their thoughts can be read via the Dream Nail, and they 
reveal that Grimm is very benevolent and caring, always guiding them 
through the darkness with his bright flames. They act as cargo -carriers, 
similar to horses, for the Troupe whenever they travel.Location: Two 
Grimmsteeds can be found at Dirtmouth, near Grimm's tent entrance.Combat: 
Players may not kill the Grimmsteeds.Associated QuestsNoneDialogueDream 
Nailed:A new land. Different f rom the last. How many more will we see?The 
roads between are dark and long, but the Master s light will always

that they possess Grimmkin markings on their faces, and long grey cloaks 
billowing out from beneath their folded 
shells.NPCsBardoon,Bretta,Brumm,Charm Lover Salubra,Cloth,Confessor

grub found. There is a total number of 46 Grubs; after finding the last 
Grub, he will provide the Grubberfly's Elegycharm. After the quest of

Notes & TipsWhat kind of bug is the Grubfather in Hollow Knight?Despite 
being called a grub (beetle larvae), the Grubfather and his young are 
technically  caterpillars known as hornworms (as said in other 
translations of the game, and based on their obvious appearance, 
especially their bright green coloration). A Grubberfly  as seen on 
theGrubberfly's Elegy Charm resembles and suggests that they metamorpho se 
into a six -winged butterfly -like creature, further confirming this.True 
grubs are the larvae of beetles; they are very plump and white in colour 
(not green), highly resemblingandsharing numerous traits with the 
Maggots  associated withFalse Knight.Othe r notesOther notes go

Lament LocationsForgotten CrossroadsGr ubfather's Lament 
WalkthroughGrubfather's location in the Forgotten Crossroads.There are 
two ways to freely start this quest, one is by visiting the Grubfatherin 
the Forgotten Crossroads, or by randomly finding all 46 Grubs he mentions and to visit him lat er on. Whichever you prefer this walkthrough will 
focus on obtaining the Collector's Map which will show youall the 
locations of the grubs scattered around the map.Location of the Love 
Keyin the Queen's Gardens.First thing you will need is to obtain the Lo ve 
Keythat is found at thesouth -eastern end of Queen's Gardens, you will 
need to have Isma's Tearin order to swim into the acid pool that is in 
between your path. Once you've acquired the ability and have passed the 
acid pool, you'll find the key at the en d of the passage next to a corpse 
- collect the key and make your way to the Tower of Lovelocated in 
between Kingdom's Edgeand the King's Station.Passage to get into the 
Tower of Love.Now, from the King's Stationit may look like you can come 
in from the bo ttom and climb your way to the top, but that path is 
blocked and currently locked. So you will have to take an alternate path 
which is by going around Kingdom's Edge and entering from the second 
level of the Tower of Love as indicated above.Upon entering t he area, you 
will find a locked door where the Love Key is required to unlock it. 
Before moving forward, make sure to drop down the path next to the door 
to find a switch that will unlock the blocked path that you encountered 
earlier from the King's Statio n- this will make it easier for you to get 
into the area in case you respawn from dying from a boss battle. After 
that's done, you can head back up from the unlocked door and follow the 
path until you reach a boss The Collector.From here, a boss battle wil l 
begin between The Knight and The Collector. His attacks consist of 
countless fast hopping around the area and jumps into the roof where he 
will throw down his "collection" with enemies in it. You will be able to 
know which part of the arena he will throw  the jars and eventually jumps 
back down by looking at the ceiling where dust will start to appear. 
Avoid where the jars will fall off, kill the weak enemies first, then 
attack The Collector, rinse and repeat until you successfully defeat 
him.After killing  The Collector, the gate at the eastern side will unlock 
allowing you to continue forward. Climb up the path, where you will find 
three Grubs and at the end of the path will be the Collector's Map - 
acquiring the map will place pins of the location of undi scovered Grubs 
around the area which will save you a lot of time exploring the area.Once 
you've cleared the map of Grubs, head back to the Grubfatherto claim your 
rewards, it doesn't matter if you head back to the Grubfather to claim 
your rewards while res cuing all of the Grubs or if you've rescued all 46 
of them since it will still end with him giving you the rewards you 
deserve - a table with the Grub's location and rewards will be listed 
below. Now, after rescuing all Grubs and claiming all your rewards,  you 
can leave the area, rest at a bench and when you return to the Grubhome, 
you will find the Grubfather has consumed all of the Grubs and is lying 
on his back stuffed. Dream nailing him will reveal that he is "happy" 
with finding all of them and consumi ng them, although it is unclear the 
reason behind him eating the little ones, is it simply because he is 
hungry? Or he used himself like a cocoon for the grubs development of 
growing into its next stage.This marks the completion of the quest and 
unlocks th e Trophies/Achievements Grubfriend for rescuing half of the 
Grubs and Metamorphosis for rescuing all 46 Grubs.Grubs Location and

 Gruz Mother LocationForgotten CrossroadsHealth90Reward50G ruz Mother is a 
Boss in Hollow Knight. Bosses are special Enemiesthat feature their own 
arena, a large amount of health, and a variety of unique moves and 
abilities.You will need to perform multiple attacks such as using The 
Nail and Nail Arts along with t heSpells and Abilitiesin order to defeat 
them. Some bosses are capable of entering into a state of stagger after landing a number of attacks on them.As soon as you encounter a boss,its 
name will appear on the screen, the music will change into a boss battl e 
theme, and usually, pathsconnecting the arena will close or will be 
blocked leaving you no choice but to face these devastating and unique 
foes.Mature gruzzer that carries its young in its belly. Attacks by 
hurling its huge body around.Bizarrely, this mo nster does not lay eggs 
but instead carries its young inside of its fat stomach. This strange 
practice seems to exhaust the creature, making it sleepy and vulnerable. 
Take advantage!Gruz Mother LocationForgotten CrossroadsGodhome (Mini -
boss)Colosseum of Fo ols (Mini -boss)   Trial of the Warrior Gruz Mother 
Rewards50Gruz Mother StrategiesStrategy WriteupThe Gruz Mother is an 
optional boss. You can first encounter her at the Forgotten Crossroads 
sleeping in front of a locked gate, striking her with The Nail wi ll cause 
her to wake up and initiate the boss battle. The first phase of the 
battle is all about facing the mother herself, she will always fly around 
the area as her way of traversing and avoiding any attacks and will 
follow up with two kinds of attacks. The first attack is a charge attack 
where she flies up high and quickly charges towards The Knight, the 
second attack is the one you need to look out for since it is a slam 
attack where she will slam her body up and down towards The Knight until 
she reache s a wall - it is dangerous to stay in one place or if you react 
late since the attack is fast, covers most of the arena and will only 
stop until hitting the wall, so it is recommended to keep your distance 
and only attack or recover health once she has rea ched the end.Once 
you've dealt enough damage, she will fall to the ground, showing that 
there is something moving inside her. Phase 2 will begin after a period 
of time where the Gruz Mother's corpse will explode and Gruzzerswill 
emerge. A few strikes with The Nail will eliminate these creatures and 
killing the last one will mark the completion of the boss battle.In the 
Colosseum of Fools, the Trial of the Warrior, two Gruz Mothers will be 
fought at once. Their attacks remain the same, the only difference is  
they will not spawn Gruzzers upon death.Since she is an optional boss and 
has low health, obtaining certain Spells and Abilitiesfirst would be 
wise. If you acquire the Mothwing Cloakability, you will be able to dodge 
easily, especially during the body sla m attack. And second is acquiring 
and using the Vengeful Spiritspell, this will allow you to inflict damage 
on the boss even though you are far away from each other.Attacks & 
CountersAttackCounterPhase 1Mother's ChargeThe first thing to take note 
of is tha t the Gruz Mother will fly all throughout the match. Its first 
attack is a charge attack where she will fly high into the air and 
follows up with a charge attack towards The Knight's position and slams 
into the ground - this attack inflicts damage upon con tact.Slam AttackIn 
conjunction with flying around the arena, the Gruz Mother's second attack 
is a slam attack where she slams her body violently onto the ceiling and 
floor while slowly moving towards The Knight. She will only stop this 
attack once she reac hes the end of the arena.Phase 2GruzzersAfter landing 
the last strike, the Gruz Mother will fall to the ground on her back, 
showing her belly that seems to be moving. After a brief moment, the 
corpse of the Gruz Mother will explode and 7 -8 Gruzzers will em erge in 
the arena. The Gruzzers will not target The Knight but will just fly 
around, bounce off walls and will inflict damage upon contact.Gruz Mother 
LoreThe mother of all Gruzzers. They are a unique creature where instead 
of laying eggs, they keep the yo ung ones inside of their stomach and 
releases them once they are strong enough. There isn't any other information on how they fit into Hallownest but are only considered to be 
a dangerous yet exhausted creature.Gruz Mother Notes & TriviaVoice Actor,

LocationGreenpathGulka Rewards6Gulka Notes & TipsA Gulka is a tricky 
enemy. From a distance it will fire a spiked ball towards The Knight's 
direction. Once you've approached it, it immediately retreats into the 
wall or ceiling it is on, making itsel f invulnerable to any attacks.To 
kill this enemy, The Knight can strike the balls it spits with The Nail, 
sending them back. Otherwise, The Knightmay use acharm that will increase 
the range of The Nail, such as Longnail,or a spellto hit it from a 
distance.  Gulka cannot retract immediately after spitting, so there is a 
tiny window where The Knight may be able to hit it in close range, but 
this is only truly useful against Gulka in hard -to-reach positions, such 
as the two above the arena where you fight the M assive Moss

Lore"Bear witness to the last and only civilisation, the eternal 
Kingdom.Hallownest." -Lore Tablet located in King's Pass.Hallownest in 
Hollow Knight is the main location where the game, Hollow Knight, takes 
place. Hallownest was once said to be a thriving kingdo m in the center of 
a wasteland, but later fell into ruin after the Infection spread.The 
Geography of HallownestThe kingdom of Hallownest consists of a boundless 
network of tunnels and caves, inhabited by sentient bugs, wild bugs, and 
other creatures.At the  beginning of the game, players find themselves on 
the surface above the kingdom. A dark, quiet, and lonely town 
calledDirtmouth stands near the entrance to Hallownest. The majority of 
thetravelersthat need to reach the kingdom usually passthrough Dirthmou th 
via King's Pass. However, as the Infection spread, the residents entered 
a state of frenzy. The roads were closed, and the bridge of King's Pass 
crumbled away.Below the surface, past theForgotten Crossroads, a new 
ecosystem has sprung. Life teems all ov er Hallownest, from verdant 
Greenpath in the West to Fungal Wastes in the South and more.To the East 
players can find Crystal Peak: a cave system filled with deposits of 
crystals, where countless miners worked to gather a bright pink mineral. 
Just below th e crystalized caves lie Hallownest's Resting Grounds, filled 
with tombs. The path does not stop there, as you can find the Kingdom's 
capital, the City of Tears, further below.The City of Tears has been 
deserted and is now filled with infected bugs. Water c an be seen pouring 
down through the cracks of the capital's roof, causing the city to be 
half-submerged under non -stop rain.Deepnest can be found bordering the 
kingdom underground. Technically Deepnest is not a part of Hallownest, as 
it was a sovereign kin gdom before the Infection. It's a dark area full of 
cramped spaces, tunnels, and chasms. On the other side isKingdom's Edge, 
which was sealed away from the capital.The deepest point of Hallownest is 
the Ancient Basin, where the Kingdom's monarch built his White Palace. 
The palace itself disappeared after the spread of the Infection. Further 
down is the The Abyss - the heart of the lands' darkness, its entrance 
closed and sealed by the king himself.The Pale KingThe inhabitats of 
Hallownest strongly believed that it was the Pale King who is responsible 
for creating the entire world and everything in it. Once a giant creature 
known as the Wyrm, he's said to have shed his shell to be more like his 
subjects. While it's also claimed that he granted them sentience and free 
will, multiple hints point at this being a lie, suggesting the monarch to 
be far from benevolent.Although he was rarely seen outside the Palace, 
everyone looked up to the Pale King as a god. Devotees worshipped him 
through the King's Idol, an icon  which depicted the King. Across the 
kingdom of Hallownest, you can find various statues and shrines of the 
Pale King.The RadianceBefore the Pale King's arrival as the Wyrm, an 
older higher being known asThe Radiance, goddess of light and dreams, was 
worshipped as a god. A statue of the Radiance was built on Hallownest's 
Crown. After the Pale King took the throne, the Radiance was enraged, and 
its anger manifested as the Infection. This reduced the bugs of Hallownest into mindless, violent husks of their fo rmer selves.The 
History of HallownestIt's said that before Hallownest, an 
ancientcivilization stood in its place. Its inhabitants worshipped the 
Void, a substance that lies at the bottom of the Abyss. Eventually, this 
ancientcivilization ceased to exist du e to unknown causes.The Void's 
enemy was called the Radiance, a higher being who had power over the 
Dream World. The Radiance was supposedly responsible for creating the 
Moth Tribe who in turn worshipped it. Apart from that, several other 
tribes then exist ed, such as the Mosskin, the Mantis Tribe and the Spider 
Tribe.At some point in time, an enormous creature known as the Wyrm 
appeared. He shed his shell and transformed, becoming the Pale King. Just 
like the Radiance, the Pale King was also a higher being.  He usurped the 
Radiance's place in the eyes of its subjects and conquered most of the 
tribes, forming Hallownest. Some parts were seized by force, while others 
submitted on their own.Hallownest became a rich kingdom, drawing in 
myriads of travelers. Howev er, its expansionism would eventually be its 
downfall.The Hollow KnightDuring the Pale King's rule the Radiance was 
nearly forgotten. Enraged, the Radiance began to appear in the bugs' 
dreams in a last effort to be remembered. This resulted in the Infectio n, 
a plague of the mind and spirit, causing the bugs to enter a state of 
frenzy.In order to stop the Radiance, the Pale King invented the Vessels. 
A Vessel is a being infused with Void. It cannot d ream, which makes it 
resilient to the Radiance's power. The  purest Vessel was trained and 
raised in the White Palace, and was named Hollow Knight. Many other 
Vessels were also created, but they were abandoned and sealed away in the 
Abyss, deemed impure.To strengthen the seal that allowed the Radiance to 
be kept wi thin the Hollow Knight, three bugs were appointed as Dreamers. 
The Dreamers were put into an eternal sleep, holding the Hollow Knight in 
stasis at the Temple of the Black Egg.With this, the Dreamers also 
succumbed to an everlasting sleep. The Hollow Knight  was hailed as a hero 
throughout Hallownest (as illustrated by a monument built in the City of 
Tears).The Fall of HallownestAt some point, the Hollow Knight s purity 
as a Vessel was tarnished due to its attachment to the Pale King. The 
Radiance used that f law to influence its mind, causing the Infection to 
reemerge and poison the minds of Hallownest's inhabitants. The Hollow 
Knight lost ability to contain the Radiance and its Infection. Most of 
Hallownest's inhabitants would succumb to the Infection. Some r esisted. 
The rest perished.As the kingdom fell, the Pale King mysteriously 
vanished together with his White Palace.With enough power and influence, 
the Radiance was able to break out of the Hollow Knight, cracking its 
shell and spreading the Infection thro ughout the kingdom. This prompted 
the return of the nameless Knight (the protagonist) to 
Hallownest.MapTrivia & Notes: Trivia and notes go here   Hollow Knight

 Heavy Blow   Cost:Geo:350Location:DirtmouthEffect:Increase the force of 
the bearer's nail, causing enemies to recoil further when hit.Heavy 
Blowin Hollow Knight is one out of the 45 Ch arms that is found in the 
game. These charms are special items that provide The Knight buffs that 
will help with both traversing Hallownest and battling its foes. Charms 
require Notches and can only be equipped and unequipped while having The 
Knight sit on  a bench.Heavy Blow Information"Formed from the nails of 
fallen warriors."Heavy Blow is a strong defensive charm that can be used 
against enemies and most importantly boss encounters. This increases the 
range of a knockback done from The Nail or Nail Art a llowing you to push 
them back for more space and the opportunity to execute successive 
attacks, to escape a strong attack from an enemy or boss, and to 
heal.However, most of the bosses will not be affected by a knockback, but 
instead, they can be put in a state of stagger - Heavy Blow not only 
increases the range of a knockback, but it also decreases the number of 
hits required to stagger an enemy by 1, which can be useful for most 
bosses.Listed below is an overview of the increased percentage added from 
the following source of attacks:Increases the knockback attack from The 
Nail by 75%.Increases the knockback attack from Great Slashand Dash 
Slashby 100%.Increases the knockback attack from Cyclone Slashby 
150%.Heavy Blow AcquisitionLocation:DirtmouthAcquisit ion: To acquire this 
charm, head over to Crystal Peakandobtain the Shopkeeper's Keywhich can

a Boss in Hollow Knight. Bosses are special Enemiesthat feature their own 
arena, a large amount of heal th, and a variety of unique moves and 
abilities.You will need to perform multiple attacks such as using The 
Nail and Nail Arts along with theSpells and Abilitiesin order to defeat 
them. Some bosses are capable of entering into a state of stagger after 
landing a number of attacks on them.As soon as you encounter a boss,its 
name will appear on the screen, the music will change into a boss battle 
theme, and usually, pathsconnecting the arena will close or will be 
blocked leaving you no choice but to face these  devastating and unique 
foes.Loyal protector of the Hive's Queen. Flightless but ferocious in 
battle.Some creatures are born with duties and loyalties marked indelibly 
upon their minds. They are strong, but they are also slaves.Hive Knight 
LocationThe Hive GodhomePantheon of the Sage Hive Knight 
RewardsHivebloodHive Knight StrategiesStrategy WriteupFor this battle, we 
recommend that you have the Shade Cloakability before jumping in the 
battle. This will allow you to phase through Hive Knight's attacks easily  
especially once you are caught up in a sticky situation. In conjunction 
with this ability, it is best to have Sharp Shadowso that you can also 
deal damage at the same time while phasing through the Hive Knight and 
its attacks.Your spells will also be your  best ally in this battle since 
most of the time you will be keeping your distance from the aggressive 
Hive Knight. Shade Soul or Vengeful Spirit is best to deal with damage 
from a distance, Desolate Diveor Descending Darkis also useful if you want to deal  damage after leaping into the air and of course, Abyss 
Shriekor Howling Wraithswill help to clear out the Hivelings - just be 
sure to have the following Charms that can buff your Spells and SOUL 
recovery, Shaman Stoneto strengthen your spells, Spell Twist erto reduce 
the cost of SOUL and Soul Eateror Soul Catcherto increase the number of 
SOULS recovered from striking an enemy with The Nail.Now as far as your 
basic attacks, it is best that you upgrade and maximize the power of The 
Nail, so be sure to visit t he Nailsmith when you can. Equipping charms 
such as Mark of Prideand Quick Slashwill allow The Knight to execute fast 
attacks with The Nail and also increases its reach - with this you'll be 
able to still deal damage while maintaining a distance from the H ive 
Knight.Attacks & CountersAttackCounterPhase 1Lunge AttackHive Knight 
performs a lunge attack where it covers almost half of the arena. Simply 
jump above or dash through the attack.Teleporting SlashHive Knight 
teleports behind The Knight and follows up with swinging his needle 
forward. The attack covers a wide range and allows the hive Knight to 
move forward, you can either jump, dash away or dash towards the attack 
and follow up with a counter -attack.Summoned SpikesThis attack only 
occurs if you've take n about 4% of Hive Knight's HP. Hive Knight slams 
his needle onto the ground causing three orbs with spikes to spawn in the 
arena. After a brief moment, it will shoot out the spikes engulfed around 
the orb. The orbs appear randomly and cannot be destroyed,  however, you 
can strike it with your nail to change its position before it sets 
off.Swarm of HivelingsHive Knight spews out Hivelings where after a brief 
moment, these Hivelings will fly down to the ground in random positions. 
You can use this opportunity  to recover SOUL by striking it with The Nail 
- they can also be killed. Just be mindful to also shift your attention 
towards the Hive Knight since it will also telegraph an attack while the 
Hivelings keep you busy.Hive Knight LoreA skilled and seasoned co mbatant 
who has dedicated his wellbeing to protecting Queen Vespa and The Hive. 
The Queen Vespa has been dead for a long time, as her ghost will inform 
you upon defeating the Hive Knight. He apparently protects her corpse and 
chamber, as well as the Hivebl ood charm, hoping that one day his queen 
will wake up and rebuild The Hive.Hive Knight Notes & TriviaHive Knight

that will help with bo th traversing Hallownest and battling its foes. 
Charms require Notches and can only be equipped and unequipped while 
having The Knight sit on a bench.Hiveblood Information"Golden nugget of 
the Hive's precious hardened nectar.'Hiveblood is a charm that has health 
regenerative properties. It aallows The Knight to recover health without 
the use of SOUL. However, Hiveblood only restores 1 health mask and 
requires The Knight to not take any damage for 12 seconds.If The Knight 
takes damage while regenerating heal th, they will need to repeat the 
process and wait for at least 12 seconds without taking any damage for 
the charm to work. Also, Hiveblood is interrupted if you use SOUL to 
heal.Hiveblood can restore Lifeblood Masks gained from Joni's Blessing, 
but it take s about 24 seconds for the charm to start regenerating.While 
the conditions listed above make Hiveblood unsuitable for combat, it can 
ensure you are virtually immortal in platforming. As long as you take the

Knight is a Boss in Hollow Knight. Bosses are special Enemiesthat feature 
their own arena, a large amo unt of health, and a variety of unique moves 
and abilities.You will need to perform multiple attacks such as using The 
Nail and Nail Arts along with theSpells and Abilitiesin order to defeat 
them. Some bosses are capable of entering into a state of stagger  after 
landing a number of attacks on them.As soon as you encounter a boss,its 
name will appear on the screen, the music will change into a boss battle 
theme, and usually, pathsconnecting the arena will close or will be 
blocked leaving you no choice but to  face these devastating and unique 
foes.Fully grown Vessel, carrying the plague's heart within its body.The

crumbling little world. The sacrifices he imposed on others... all for 
nothing.Hol low Knight LocationTemple of the Black EggHollow Knight 
RewardsN/AHollow Knight StrategiesStrategy WriteupHollow Knight has 4 
phases, each phase will begin with the Hollow Knight leaning its head 
backward and releasing a loud battle cry. Phase 1 will consi st of three 
attacks that will be telegraphed by the Hollow Knight from phases 1 
through 3. In phase 2, the Hollow Knight gains two more attacks that are 
telegraphed until phase 3. Now in the 3rd phase, the Hollow Knight will 
perform new attacks but will mo ve less and loses the triplecut and dash 
attacks from phase 1. Phase 4 on the other hand, the Hollow Knight will 
only attack with its single strike and overhead bounce attacks.At this 
point in the game, we'll assume you've fully upgraded your Nail, Spells 
and have obtained the needed abilities and charms. Charms: It is 
important to have Quick Focusand Quick Slashequipped for this battle, 
you'll need that extra speed of recovering health and landing multiple 
blows using the Nail. In conjunction with Quick Sl ash, combining it with 
Longnailor Mark of Pridecan help you land yourbasic attack from a 
distance. Grubsongis also recommended so that you can gain SOUL from 
taking damage and not just by hitting the boss and [airing the Grubsong 
charm with Thorns of Agony will allow you to inflict some damage whenever 
you take a hit.Attacks & CountersAttackCounterPhase 1Triple Cut 
AttackWith the Monarch Wings obtained, jump on top of the Hollow Knight 
and perform a down attack to pogo on it.ParryDo not attack with ANY TYPE 
OF ATTACKS while it is in the parry stance. Jump over it and strike it at 
its back.Dash AttackEither dash through its attack with the help of Shade

the gap of the flames. There is a slight delay before the pillars of fire 
appear after the Hollow Knight slams down onto the ground.Barrage of 
BlobsDash towards the Hollow Knight to avoid the blob of Infection it 
casts out. The attackshoots from the bottom and will make its way 
up.Phase 3F renzied BarrageWatch out for where the blobs will land and use 
the gaps to avoid getting hit.Overhead BounceThe only way to avoid this 
is by the timing and dashing away before it bounces onto your 
position.Phase 4Single StrikeKeep your distance once the Ho llow Knight 
swings its nail and attack once it falls onto its knees.Hollow Knight 
LoreThe Hollow Knight is aVessel, a mysterious empty insectoid being with 
long stag -beetle-like horns, a creation of the Pale King of Hallownest and the White Lady. Just like  its siblings, it was created as a Vessel 
and is infused with the power of the Void to seal The Radianceand stop 
the spread of The Infection for eternity.Upon their birth, all Vessels 
have been conditioned to have no mind, no will, and no voice or ability 
to feel pain, to prevent The Radiance from influencing them. However, 
this Vessel  (named the Hollow Knight  by the Pale King) developed 
differently, as it formed a bond between itself and The Pale King(who was 
like a father to it in addition to its creato r) while it was being 
trained and raised into a full grown Vessel.Eventually, The Radiance and 
its Infection was sealed within the Hollow Knight, and it was chained and 
sealed within the Temple of the Black Egg. Being a knight (raised by a 
sovereign to bec ome a warrior and serve the king and kingdom) it served 
its kingdom by sacrificing itself in this manner. At some point, due to 
the impurity of the Hollow Knight, its emotional attachment to its 
creator and father, the Pale King, The Radiancewas able to in fluence the 
chosen Vessel, causing its shell to crack, and it was then consumed by 
the Infection. This lead to the spread of The Infection which also lead 
to the fall of the Kingdom of Hallownest.Hollow Knight Notes &

GameDescend Into a Vast, Ruined WorldThe story of Hollow Knight takes 
place in afictional underground kingdom of bugs namedHallownest, which is 
on the brink of destruction by a divine being known as T he Radiance. The 
Radiance seeks to corrupt the kingdom by infecting Hallownests citizens, 
breaking their minds and forsaking their wills, causing them to attack 
uninfected bugs. They act mindlessly, continuing the common daily 
lifestyle of their previous l ife such as marching around the City of 
Tears as a guard, and will attack any non -infected being they see.The 
story of The Hollow Knight begins with the protagonist, The Knight, a 
strange Vessel, suddenly arriving in Dirtmouth after he was 
telepathically c alled. This mysterious nameless Knight begins his journey 
through Hallownest by uncovering the forgotten kingdom's darkest secrets, 
and seeking to save the kingdom from the impending doom that 
awaits.TheMysterious Black EggAwaiting in the Forgotten Crossro adslies 
the source of the infection: The Temple of the Black Egg. As a vessel 
named the Hollow Knight, it is your duty to rid Hallownest from the 
infection by unlocking the Egg and destroying the infection from within. 
To do so, you will need to break the seal by defeating the 3 dreamers of 
Hallownest: Monomon the Teacher, Lurien the Watcher, and Herrah the 
Beast. As a vessel, you must find the bodies of these 3 dreamers and wake 
them from their eternal sleep in order to open the Temple of the Black 
Egg. You will face many perils and dangers in pursuit of unlocking the 
egg, and exploring the ruined regions of Hallownest; From gargantuan bugs 
to infected monstrosities, you must face anything the vast world throws 
at you, and become strong enough to save it.It  is here in The Temple of 
the Black Egg where you will face the challenge of how you will defeat 
the infection, and save the kingdom of Hallownest from The Radianceand 
its evil corruption. How you choose to do so will determine which of the Hollow Knight E ndingsyou will get. After getting one ending, you can try 
to get the other endings on the same save file, so dont worry about 
locking in to one ending you like.A Ruined Kingdom Awaiting a SaviorOn 
The Knightsjourney to save Hallownest, he will find the var ious regions 
of Hallownest which have been transformed as a result of the infection. 
The constructed roads in the caverns of Dirtmouth which used to 
conviniently led to the kingdoms capital have been overrun with 
vegetation, and infested with not just infe cted bugs, but also toxic 
mushrooms and more. In reflection of the state of the Kingdom, the 
capital's name which had been long forgotten was named The City Of Tears, 
also mirroring the endless rain that falls onto the once prospering 
city.The further you venture into this decaying kingdom, the more secrets 
you will unveil about its old ruler, The Pale King, including your 
purpose and role as a Hollow Knight in the liberation of Hallownest from 
the infection which threatens to cause the extincion of all bug s and 
ultimately bring about the downfall of Hallownest.Master New PowersAs The 
Knightprogresses in the game, he must become more powerful in order to 
face the mutations created by the test of time and continue on his duties 
as a vessel. New areas explored  and interactions with various NPCs will 
eventually yield new powerful Spells and Abilitieswhich can be used to 
defeat powerful Enemies and Bosses, or traverse areas in Hallownest which 
could not be accessed before.Explore Hidden Areas with NewSpells and 
AbilitiesHidden behind Bosses or within secret Locationslies a variety of 
spells and abilities which can be used to unlock new areas of the game, 
or simply create shortcuts between certain Locations. Each ability The 
Knightacquires marks a new milestone in the progression of the game. 
There are a multitude of paths which you are prohibited from entering 
from the moment you step foot into Hallownest, and you will find yourself 
lost in options of which way to go after acquiring a new traversal 
spell.You are gi ven the freedom to choose whichever path entices you the 
most in the game, and are always rewarded for any exploration you do, be 
it with Geo, new Spells and Abilities or Key Itemsthat help you progress 
the game. There are many times you will feel lost fro m the freedom that 
you are given, but the moment you unlock one of these new paths is an 
experience that is unique to Hollow Knight.Master Ancient Nail ArtsThe 
Nail is the primary and signature weapon of The Knight, requiring no 
Soulto use. It can be upgra ded later on in the game, and can also be 
utilised to master the ancient Nail Arts which have been mastered by 
various NPCs you meet. You will be offered teachings by the Nailmasters 
to acquire these special skills, and utilise them against the Enemies and  
Bosses you face later.The damage of the Nail Art also depends on the type 
of Nail that is equipped or upgraded as well as Charms that can also 
change certain effects such as damage and charge time. Be sure to use 
Nail arts in between damage phases for max imum damage potential against 
Bosses.Unleash the Might of CharmsAnother way that The Knight gets 
stronger in Hollow Knight is through equipping the various Charms in the 
game.There are a total of 45 different Charms available in Hollow Knight, 
including th e Charms from all of the free DLC. Some Charms you acquire 
are special, and can be upgraded through accomplishing certain tasks. The 
Knight may only equip a certain number of Charms depending on how many 
Notches he has acquired, which will increase through out the progression 
in the game.Unique and Powerful Charm BuffsYou will recieve up to 40 
Charms throughout the game, with each benefitting The Knight in a 
different, unique way. Some Charms may simply increase The Knights Nail damage/range, or decrease the  Soul cost of Spells and Abilities. Other 
charms can provide you with companions to fight alongisde with, or give 
you a unique healthbar which has extra masks or maybe even regenerates 
over time.There are dozens of different effects thatCharms can provide,  
and its up to you how you wish to build The Knight; whether that is 
becoming the ultimate exploration master or becoming extremely formidable 
in Combat. There are also Charms in the game which can be upgraded by 
either progressing an NPCs storyline, or sp ending heaps of Geo to do so. 
These Charms are especially powerful, and can be unlocked later on in the 
game.Overcharming The KnightIf you are a high risk high reward player, 
you may be interested in this mechanic. If you equip a Charm which has a 
Notch Co st which would exceed your current Notch Limit 5 times, you may 
become Overcharmed. In this state, you have all the buffs from the Charms 
you have equipped, including the one which would exceed your Notch Limit, 
but you take twice the damage.Overcharmed in  Hollow Knight is an 
extremely risky mechanic to utilise, and only some can pull it off. It 
becomes necessary in the later stages of the game where some special 
Bosses can defeat The Knight with one hit, making the double damage 
debuff obsolete. However, i f you are willing to risk the damage 
potential, you can become extremely strong by overcharming up to 4 
Notches.Befriend Bizzare BugsHallownestis a kingdom of bugs, thus you 
will find some bug friends along The Knight'sjourney. Since most bugs 
have been in fected or killed by The Infection, most sentient bugs reside 
in the small, relatively safe town of Dirtmouthwhich is where The Knight 
begins his Journey to become the Hollow Knight. Bugs can provide you with 
items that you need to upgrade your Equipment,or provide you with useful 
Mapsand even teach you ancient Nail Arts which can be used against 
Enemies and Bosses.Cornifer, the Helpful CartographerOne of the most 
important and friendly bugs you will meet in your journey is Cornifer, a 
cartographer willing to  sell you Maps of the Locations in Hallownest for 
a small amount of Geo. He lives in Dirtmouth with his wife Iselda, and 
spends his days exploring all of Hallownest and drawing up a huge map of 
the ruined kingdom.His wife Iselda can also sell you special i tems, one 
of which being the extremely helpful Wayward Compass Charm and others 
being complamentary to the Maps you acquire, such as pins for special 
locations such as Vendors and Hot Springs.Challenge Over 30 Epic 
BossesBosses inHollow Knightare character ized in the game as Enemies that 
have a higher amount of health and do more damage, unlike the normal 
enemies that wander around the various regions of Hallownest. These 
Bosses are special and important since some need be defeated in order to 
progress thro ugh the main game, whereas some drop important Items.In 
Hollow Knight, there will be a total of 47 Bossesfor you to defeat, with 
some having more powerful variants included in this number.Below is a 
catalogue of the range of Bosses that exist in the game, as well as a 
link which will take you to the related boss page if you wish.Barter, 
Upgrade, Train, Travel and RelaxThere exist a multitude of things to do 
in Hollow Knight, with plenty of options for The Knight. You can buy 
Items from the friendly bug NPCs  of Hallownest, upgrade theNailas well as 
your Spells and Abilities, train The Knight to learn newNail Arts, 
explore what the world has to offer and even hang out in one of the many 
hot springs in the game.Hollow Knight MediaHollow Knight is defined by 
its unique art style and approach to world design. From mines to a forest 
palace or a challenging arena, each area is crafted beautifully and contrasts with the game's imposing pace and challenging gameplay.Check

 Hornet   Location Greenpath, (boss fight), Fungal Wa stes, City of Tears, 
Kingdom's Edge (boss fight), Deepnest Hornet is an NPCin Hollow Knight. 
Hornet is an arachnid warrior who wears a curved mask shaped vaguely like 
a boomerang, with two dark eye -holes near the bottom. In addition, Hornet 
wears a red dre ss-like cloak and wields a needle and silk as her weapon. 
Hornet primarily acts as an anti -hero, and her involvement unlocks 2 
possible endings in Hollow Knight.To see the page for Hornet as one of 
the Bosses, click here.Hollow Knight Hornet LoreHornet was  raised in the 
Deepnest, and survived the fall and the Infection of the kingdom. She 
wanders around its ruins, chasing off all travelers and outsiders whom 
she automatically assumes are trying to desecrate the place (despite most 
of them being harmless). S he puts on an imperious facade to compensate 
for her lack of ability to truly protect the kingdom crumbling around 
her.At first she is antagonistic toward the Knight, trying to kill them 
and primarily acting as an anti -hero.Hornet's initial purpose is to 
protect the sealing of the Black Egg. She also guards the Cast -Off Shell in Kingdom's Edge. After some time, she was able to sense the awakening 
of the Infection and started off on a journey to travel across Hallownest 
in search for answers.Hollow Knight Ho rnet InformationHornet is the 
daughter of Herrah the Beast, the queen of Deepnest, and The Pale King. 
Her birth was the result of a bargain: her mother would become a Dreamer 
if the King granted her a child. As such, Hornet spent only a short time 
with Her rah, though she remembers it with fondness and seems to admire 
her mother. Her shared heritage with The Knight and the rest of the 
Vessels makes them siblings.Where to Find Hornet: Hornet can be first 
found in Greenpath, where she will appear a number of t imes before you 
battle her at the end of the area. Then you'll briefly encounter her 
again in the City of Tears. She will then move on to Kingdom's Edge, 
where you will fight her the second time. If you're going for "Dream No 
More" or "Sealed Siblings" end ing, she will rejoin you in the Abyss with 
some dialogue, and finally meet up with you at the Black Egg Temple 
(provided you have Void Heart).Hornet Story Progression: Hornet then 
moves toKingdom's Edge afteryou defeather in Greenpath.Hornet Combat 
Information: Hornet is fought twice, first in Greenpath, second in 
Kingdom's Edge. In Kingdom's Edge, she uses more attacks and moves more 
quickly.Rewards for defeating Hornet: Defeating Hornet inGreenpath will 
reward you with the Mothwing Cloakand the Test of Re solve 
Trophy/Achievement. Defeating her in Kingdom's Edge will reward you with 
the King's Brandand the Proof of Resolve Trophy/Achievement.Hollow Knight 
Hornet Associated EndingsOne of two possible endings involving Hornet: 
Sealed Siblings - A semi-hidden ending. To get this ending, obtain the 
Void Heart and enter the Black Egg. When Hornet interrupts, don't strike 
the Hollow Knight with your Dream Nail, but continue your attacks. Hornet 
will eventually get knocked out and pass out and the fight continues. 
Beat the Hollow Knight to get this ending. In this ending, you take the 
Hollow Knight's place, but because Hornet is sealed with you, she can 
never escape. The cycle is ended forever as no new knights can enter the 
Black Egg and Hallownest will eventually succumb to the Infection.The 
other possible ending involving Hornet:Dream No More - To get this 
ending, obtain a fully awakened Dream Nail by defeating the various 
spirit bosses, the Champion versions of False Knight (Failed Champion), 
Soul Master (Soul Ty rant), and Broken Vessel (Lost Kin). Additional 
essence can be gained from the various nonhostile spirits and the Dream 
Trees scattered around the map. You need a total of 1800 essence to fully 
awaken the Dream Nail. Additionally, go to the Queen's Gardens  and obtain 
the White Crest Fragment.After awakening the Dream Nail, strike the 
Kingsmould sitting in the Palace Grounds. This will transport you to the 
Dream World, where you must complete the White Palace's platforming 
challenge. At the end of the palace , strike the Pale King until his 
exoskeleton drops from the throne. After striking the King's corpse, you 
must pick up the other half of the Kingsoul. This will make you leave the 
Dream World.Equip the Kingsoul and enter the Abyss. Go to the bottom -most 
section of the Abyss and enter the newly opened cave area. Descend down 
the area, defeating or dodging the Siblings. At the bottom of the Abyss, 
strike the mirror with your Dream Nail to travel into the Dr eam World. 
This will permanently change the Kingsoul into the Void Heart.Afterward, 
go to the Black Egg. Hornet will be waiting outside. Enter the Egg and 
fight The Hollow Knight. Halfway through the fight, Hornet will interrupt 
by hitting the Hollow Knight with her nail and tying him down. Hit the 
Hollow Kn ight with the Dream Nail. At this point, The Radiance will appear. It is a three -stage boss fight. After you complete it, the Hollow 
Knights Shade form will assist you along with all of the Siblings, and 
you can watch the ending cutscene. In this ending, you kill the Radiance 
and end the Infection.Hollow Knight Hornet DialogueCome no closer, 
ghost.I've seen you, creeping through the undergrowth, stalking me.This 
old kingdom... A terrible thing awakens. I can smell it in the air...I 
know what you are. I kno w what you'd try to do. I can't allow 
it.Shaw!Hollow Knight Hornet Notes & TipsIn Hornet's second fight, she 
rarely stays in place long enough for more than two nail strikes. Because 
of this, it is useful to charge up Nail Arts strikesin between hits to 
allow players to deal more damage when an opening presents itself.Hornet 
is the only creature in Hollow Knight to wield a Needle.She is the

Hornet StrategiesStrategy WriteupHornet is one of t he bosses you can 
encounter at the early part of the game, so do not underestimate her 
since she is an early boss that has increased movement speed and has a 
short recovery time allowing her to execute her attacks frequently. You 
will encounter Hornet in a  boss fight twice in Hollow Knight. First is 
when you meet her for the first time in Greepath, and second is when you 
meet her at Kingdom's Edge. Whenever she performs a ground lunge attack, 
take that opportunity to jump over her and land a few strikes to damage 
her and recover SOUL. Since you are in the early stage of the game, the 
only spell you possibly have acquired is Vengeful Spirit, it is 
recommended that you use this spell whenever she executes her storm of 
threads attack.Other than that take your t ime and try to consume your 
SOUL wisely both offensively and defensively.When you encounter Hornet for the second time at Kingdom's Edge, she will challenge you to test 
your resolve and strength in saving Hallownest. This is the second time 
you'll be facin g her in a boss fight, and this time, she'll be using her 
full strength and abilities. Hornet would still have the same moveset and 
tactics as when you first fought her, but her attacks will be a lot 
faster now. She also has two additional moves during thi s fight. You can 
use the same strategy as before, but you will have to react faster as 
well. Take advantage of the Spells and Abilitiesyou've already acquired 
in the process before you run into her the second time.Attacks & 
CountersAttackCounterPhase 1Grou nd LungeHornet dashes and lunges with her 
needle on the ground. You can jump evade this attack by jumping on top of 
her.Aerial LungeHornet jumps into the air and charges for a lunge attack 
towards The Knight in a 45 -degree angle. Hornet dives in for the at tack 
at the last position The Knight will be while she charges midair, use 
that opportunity to predict where she will land in order to evade her 
attack.Needle ThrowHornet throws her needle for about mid -range and pulls 
it back with the thread attached to t he needle's eye. You can avoid this 
attack by jumping on top of her nail and executing a downward strike on 
Hornet's needle to pogo off it. Be mindful that The Knight can still take 
damage upon contact with both the Needle and Thread.Storm of ThreadHornet 
unleashes an AOE attack where her Thread engulfs around her for a brief 
period. She can perform this attack both on the ground and in the air. 
You can easily dodge this since she telegraphs this attack in place. If 
you want to be aggressive you can damage her by using Vengeful 
Spirit.ParryHornet will hold her needle and strike a defensive stance, if 
you hit her during this stance, you will hear her giggle before 
unleashing a wide -range slash of counterattack. So don't go charging in 
pressing buttons, this t elegraphed parry is very noticeable so you should 
be able to counter her attempt in countering you easily.SpikeHornet will 
use her thread to suspend spiked balls in the air, these spikes will deal 
contact damage and will remain there unless it's destroyed by either Nail 
attacks or Spells. The maximum number of spikes she can set at a time is 
6, and she won't be using this move unless you've already reduced her 
health to about 480 HP.Hollow Knight Hornet LoreHornet is the mysterious 
princess, protector, and guardian of Hallownest's ruins. She is the 
offspring of the queen of DeepnestHerrah the Beast and Hallownest's Pale 
King. Her existence was the result of a bargain made by her mother with 
her father: Herrah would become a Dreamer only if The Pale King woul d 
grant her a child. After Hornet was born, the mother and daughter were 
given little time to spend together, but Hornet says she remembers it 
fondly.She was then raised in Deepnest by the weavers. She was able to 
avoid The Infection and this survive the f all of the Kingdom of 
Hallownest with her sanity intact. Once she was ready, she became the 
protector and guardian of Hallownest's ruins, where she fends off those 
who pose a threat or try to seek out answers to the Kingdom's fall and 
the ancientsecret sea led inside the Black Egg.Hollow Knight Hornet Notes

It is asub -area within the Royal Waterwaysthat are filled with acid  pools

SentryWinged SentryIsma's Grove WalkthroughFinding Isma's Grove and 
Isma's TearIn order to gain access into Isma's Grove, you'll need to 
defeat the Dung Defenderfirst in  the Royal Waterwaysand then flip the 
lever that drains the acid water blocking the path that leads into the 
grove. From the Dung Defender's arena and after draining the acid water, 
you'll want to retrace your course back to the entrance leading to the 
arena of the Dung Defender.From here, you'll have to head southeast 
towards the path where you'll encounter a Pilflipand eventually, an 
opening you'll have to jump down into that leads into the next section. 
Now, follow the path then drop down to the bottom b y hopping onto the 
elevated platforms until you reach the pool of acid. Next, head east 
until you reach a ledge with a crystal which indicates that you'll have 
to use theCrystal Heartability to get across. Don't stop until you reach 
the next section after crossing the passage that has spikes.Once you've 
reached the section, drop down while clinging onto the wall and use the 
Crystal Heartability upon reaching the crystal formation to get across. 
You'll eventually slam onto the wall where you'll now need to c limb up. 
You'll now encounter yet another pool of acid that has elevated platforms 
and multiple Hwurmpenemies floating around. Make it across then head to 
the top right side until you reach a sign from the Dung Defenderon the 
wall.Upon entering, you'll wan t to climb up the column until you reach 
the top. Be careful since you'll encounter 2x Winged Sentryas you climb 
to the top. When you get to the top, continue heading east then drop down 
into the 2nd column near the pool of acid where you'll arrive in a sm all 
arena.The gates will immediately close and you'll have to fight three 
waves of sentry enemies in order for the gates to re -open. After clearing 
the last wave, head east and follow the path where you'll respectively 
arrive in Isma's Grove. From here, go  east and jump across by using the 
platforms until you reach the end where you'll find Isma's Tear - this 
ability repels acid which will allow The Knight to swim in acidic waters 
without taking any damage.Rescue a GrubFrom where you picked up Isma's 
Tear, drop down into the pool of acid and swim to your right where you'll 
find a secret path. Climb up the wall and you'll find a trapped Grub. 
From here, you can retrace your steps back to the Dung Defender's arena 
where we'll head to the next location, the Anci ent Basin.Video[video goes

Pass is the starting area of the game where players can get the feel of 
the game's basic controls and combat systems. It is also the path that 
leads to Dirtmouth.Arriving in King's PassOnce you gain control ofThe 
Knight, head left first to find a small cache of Geo. Strike it with your 
nail to obtain it. Once that's done, head right through the path and 
destroy the gates until you reach a section that has elevated platforms - 
just be careful since you will encounter 2x Crawlidalong the way.Before 
going up the platforms, drop down and head right where you'll find 
another Crawlidand a small cache of Geo at the end. Destroy it to obtain 
Geo. Now, jump on the platforms and head left where you'll find a tablet that will glow once you appr oach it. Read it to learn about how to 
collect SOUL and how to use FOCUS.Continue going left after reading it 
where you'll now encounter 1xVengefly and more elevated platforms, ignore 
that first and continue going left where you'll find a breakable door, 
destroy it and head to the top to find another cache of Geo - there will 
be another Vengeflyin this room. Return to the previous section after 
collecting the geo and head to the top left part until you reach a corner 
with blue flowers and a Lifeblood Egg. D estroythe egg and the blobs to 
obtain 2x Lifeblood Maskthat will grant The Knighta temporary health 
boost.After collecting the lifeblood masks, go right where a Crawlidcan 
be found. After killing it, walk slowly until the floor collapses. Try 
and walk at t he edge where the floor will start to collapse so that you 
can jump below a small corridor that has another cache of Geo.Acquiring 
your First CharmOnce you've collected the Geo, head to the bottom part of 
the area that has small elevated platforms above sp iked floors. As soon 
as you jump on the platforms, spiked rocks will fall down from the 
ceiling. Upon reaching the 3rd small platform, jump down and head right 
into another section where you can find a cache of Geo and a path 
consisting of a spiked pit.It may look impossible to cross the path, but 
you can cross by jumping and performing a downward slash that will allow 
The Knight to pogo off it. Once you've crossed the path, head down to 
find another tablet for you to read. From here, you'll find a chest 
containing a charm, the Fury of the Fallen - hit the chest to open it and 
the charm will spring out from inside.After obtaining your first charm, 
head left to drop back down the section where you encountered a Vengefly 
and elevated platform. Head back to the top, and through the spiked 
floors. Only this time, head to the top right until you reach a breakable 
wooden leg. Strike it to destroy the walkway.The Path to DirtmouthAfter 
you've destroyed the ceiling, head up where you'll find another tablet 
saying that  you are now entering the Kingdom of Hallownest. Continue 
going right where you'll find a huge gate, continuously strike it with 
The Nail to destroy it. Upon entering the next area, drop down and

Edge WalkthroughGetting to the Kingdom's EdgeThere are two ways to reach 
the Kingdom's Edge, first is via the tram from the Ancient Basinor by 
taking the route from the Cit y of Tears. For this walkthrough, we'll take 
the path via the tram. From here, head east and then head up to the top 
of the cavern then east again until you come across a breakable wall that 
will respectively take you to Kingdom's Edge.Rescue the GrubsTher e are 
two sections that you can find that will take you to the location of two 
nearby grubs. First, from the entrance leading to Kingdom's Edge, there's 
a breakable floor next to where you broke the wall which opens up a path 
to The Hive. Upon arriving at The Hive, you can find one Grub on the west 
side of the room. The second grub can be found at the topmost cavern of 
the room before the entrance of Kingdom's Edge where you can find an exit 
that leads to the Royal Waterways. If you continue climbing to the  top, 
you'll come across a cluster of crystal which prompts you to use the 
Crystal Heartability. Use it to super dash, then stop halfway where 
you'll see a Hwurmp. From here, climb up the passage that will lead you 
to where the second Grub is - once you've  rescued the two grubs, head 
back to the entrance of Kingdom's Edge.Finding CorniferFirst, you'll need 
to acquire a copy of the map. As soon as you enter, you'll notice a piece 
of paper on the ground. Follow the trail that will lead you to the 
northwestern  part of thearea where you'll find Cornifer inside a small 
room. Speak to him to buy a copy of the map for 112 Geo.Nailmaster 
OroOnce you've acquired the map, drop back down to the acid water and go 
right into the next section that leads to Nailmaster Oro.  Here, you'll 
encounter Hoppers, Primal Aspidsand 3xGreat Hopperas you continue heading 
east. Eventually, you'll reach a bench and Nailmaster Oro's hut at the 
end. Enter the hut and speak to Nailmaster Oro to learn the Dash 
SlashNail Art. But in order toma ster it, you'll have to pay 800 Geo - 
when you're done head back outside and go right from the bench to find a 
training dummy and a SOUL Totem and the east end.A Secret PathFrom the 
SOUL Totem, walk back a little near the training dummy where you'll come 
across a breakable ground. Use Desolate Diveto break through the ground 
and into the cavern below. You'll find another SOUL Totem to your left and a yet another breakable ground just next to it, break through the 
ground again to dive deeper into the cavern where you'll encounter 2x 
Hopper.From here, gowestthen head to the top to find another SOUL Totem 
to your right and another breakable ground to your left close to the end. 
Breakthrough the ground until you reach the lair of aGreat Hopper. From 
here, you'll  want to head east until you reach the end where you'll find 
a trapped Grub - quickly break the jar and dash back down to avoid 
getting hit by the spiked rocks that will fall down from the 
ceiling.After rescuing the Grub, head back down and hug the wall to  your 
right where you can find a breakable wall. Destroy it to open up a path 
that leads to an opening of another cavern that you can enter, be sure 
you have enough SOUL since you'll be using the Desolate Diveability 
multiple times to reach the deepest bot tom part of the area. At the end 
of the path, you'll find a huge deposit of Geo that grants you 420 Geo 
(nice) - once you're done, climb back up and retrace your course back to 
the spiked path where you encountered the Great Hopperand head west into 
the next section.Obtain the Quick Slash CharmUpon entering the next 
section, head west where you'll find a Great Hopperand Primal Aspids. 
Fight your way through the Great Hopper then continue up the elevated 
platforms until you reach about midway to find a door to your right. Go 
inside where you'll find the Quick Slashcharm on the altar of the ancient 
nailsmith, now leave and continue heading to the top.A Second Encounter 
with HornetNext,you'llhave to look for Hornet. But before doing so, 
you're going to have to take a detour and find a few secret paths. Upon 
reaching the top, break through the wall and head northwest at the top 
corner of the room where you'll find a small cluster of geo and the next 
section above.Upon entering the next section head left, the path  on the 
right, however, leads to another dream warrior named Markoth. But in 
order to get through, you'll need to acquire the Shade Cloakability to 
pass through the stream of void that's blocking the path. So, for now, 
head left, climb up the ledges and he ad into the next section at the top 
northeastern side.Now, there is a secret path that leads to a Grub. To 
get there, head east, dash through the spiked pit and break the wall 
ahead of you to open up the path. Now climb up the wall while avoiding 
the spike s. Once you get to the top, you'll see 1x Primal Aspidpatrolling 
the area, kill it first then proceed to your left where you'll find the 
trapped Grub. After that's done, head back to where you entered, head up, 
then east, then up again where you'll find a bent bench sign. You'll have 
to hit the ceiling to destroy it which will open up the section that will 
take you outside where the bench is. You can also pick up 1x Wanderer's 
Journaljust next to the corpse of a bug.When you're done, head back down 
then eas t until you see Hornet. Follow her into the next section and then 
drop all the way down which will take you to the arena where Hornet 
awaitsBoss Battle, HornetOnce you approach her, a short dialogue will 
follow and the battle will begin afterward. This wil l be your second 
encounter with Hornet - she'll be using the same attacks that she was 
doing during the first encounter, however, she'll have an additional 
attack where she throws out multiple star -liked needles around the arena. 
You can counter this by hit ting it with The Nail to clear it out. In 
addition to this, she'll also have more health, about 700 HP. You can

she is defeated, she will retreat and the gates will re -open. Continue t o 
the right then down until you reach the exterior of what seems to look 
like the head of The Pale King. Head inside where you'll respectively arrive in a sub -area called the Cast -Off Shell - at the end, you'll find 
the King's Brandthat will allow you acce ss into the next location, The

Locations in Hollow Knight consists of the ruins of the forgotten kingdom 
ofHallownest. At the surface of Hallownest also lies a small vill age 
called Dirtmouthwhere the last and survivinginsects of Hallownest inhabit 
the village. The environment of Hallownest provides the player an 
opportunity of exploring and discovering exquisite areas that will allow 
you to understand and rediscover the se crets of the fallen 
kingdom.Exploration inHollow KnightMap and QuillExploration in Hollow 
Knight can be made effortless by purchasing a Map and Quill, this will 
allow The Knight to map a discovered area such as rooms, passages, and 
chambers that lie hidden  within Hallownest. First, an incomplete map is 
needed that can be purchased from Cornifer, where usually, Cornifer 
appears each time a player defeats an area Boss. And the Quill can, later 
on, be purchased from Iselda - in case you miss the chance to inte ract 
with Cornifer, Iselda can also sell parts of the map for a higher rate. 
Once players have purchased both items and have discovered new areas, 
players need to locate and rest at a Bench in order to update the 
map.BenchBenches in Hollow Knight are check points that are scattered 
around the map, The Knight can use the Bench for several reasons, such as 
a respawn area, restoration of Health, equipping and managing Charms, and 
to update the map. Some benches in the map can be used freely, while 
others requir e The Knight to pay a small amount of Geo by using a Toll 
Machinefor it to be used - as you progress through the game, a Bench Pin 
can be purchased from Iselda that will allow the players to reveal the 
locations of each Bench in an area that has both been discovered and 
updated in the map.Map of HallownestHollow Knight LocationsLocations in

Lore in Hollow Knight is an overview of the game's general plot. The 
story of Hollow Knight is less of a l inear journey and more of a puzzle 
that can be pieced together through different aspects of the game, such 
as cutscenes, dialogues, lore tablets and entries in theHunter's Journal. 
Due to the inherent ambiguity of environmental storytelling, much of the 
lore is open to interpretation.Hollow Knight Lore   Hollow Knight Lore     
The Knight     NPCs     Enemies     Bosses  Before Hallownest existed, 
the land was split between tribes of insectoid and arachnoid beings: the 
moths who worshipped The Radiance, plan t-like beings in Greenpath who 
worshipped Unn, the mantises, the mushrooms, the spiders and so forth. 
Then a higher being known as the Wyrm traveled to the land of Kingdom's 
Edge and metamorphosed into the Pale King.He shrank himself to appear 
like the bug s that inhabited the land, and built the kingdom of 
Hallownest. Ultimately he sought to expand his kingdom to encompass all 
of the nearby lands and tribes, whether it was through diplomacy or 
force. One way or another the bugs began to follow him, and in d oing so 
surrendered their old religions. Among them were the Moths, who abandoned 
their old deity, The Radiance.The Radiance began to appear in the dreams 
of bugs in an attempt to re -establish its following. These visions caused 
most of them to go insane, which became known as The Infection.The Pale 
King countered The Radiance by creating Vessels, living insectoid beings 
made from Void, which the Radian ce was powerless against as they had no 
dreams or free will. Though thousands of Vessels were created, the  Pale 
King only chose the purest Vessel to become the Hollow Knight . This 
Pure Vessel was then used as an instrument to seal The Radiance within 
itself and locked inside a vault called the Black Egg Temple.For extra 
protection, the Pale King appointed th ree bugs, known as theDreamers, to make a seal that would stop the Infection. Monomon was a jellyfish -like 
scholar and teacher, Lurien was the enigmatic watcher of the City of 
Tears, and Herrah was the rebellious queen of Deepnest. Monomon and 
Lurien volun teered to become Dreamers while Herrah made a deal with the 
Pale King to produce achild. The Dreamers entered stasis to protect the 
Hollow Knight's slumber.The Hollow Knight s shell eventually cracked due 
to a small flaw in its purity (its emotional attach ment toits creator and 
father the Pale King, who raised and trained it). The Infection began to 
leak out, corrupting the minds and bodies of everyone in Hallownest. The 
kingdom came to ruin, and the Pale King vanished in the chaos, along with 
his court and  palace.The story of The Hollow Knight begins with the 
protagonist, The Knight, arriving in Dirtmouth on the border of the old 
kingdom. The Knight begins their journey through the ruins of Hallownest, 
seeking answers to the mysteries of their own past. The  Knight   The 
Knight in Hollow Knight is the protagonist of the game. See their page 
below for more information.The KnightThe Knightis a strange being known 
as aVessel, created bythe higher beings The Pale King and The White Lady. 
They were born in the Aby ss, which was later sealed. It is unknown how 
they escaped the Abyss.Hornet mentions in the City of Tears that the 
Knight is "born from two voids", one being the Void that the Knight was 
created in, and the other the area outside of Hallownest. The time th at 
the Knight has spent out there has caused a temporary amnesia, but 
granted them strength and resilience.Hornet also states that once the 
Knight obtains a Void Heart and gains back their memories, they will have 
the power to unify the Void under their ow n will.The Knight starts off 
with an Old Nail and the ability to heal themself with the use of Soul. 
As you dive deep in to the game, the Knight will be given access to new 
spells, powers, abilities, items, and upgrades that will aid them in 
their bizarre journey.The Knight Health and SoulHealth MaskThe Health of 
the Knight is represented by masks in the upper -left corner of the 
screen. The Knight starts off with 5 masks; more can be obtained by 
finding Mask Shards. 4 Mask Shards make up 1 newHealth Mask, u p to a 
maximum number of 9 Masks in total. The Knight loses health by taking 
damage from enemies or environmental hazards. Health can be regained by 
either resting at a Bench or by using Focus.Lifeblood MaskLifeblood Masks 
are temporary masks that cannot b e healed with Focus. They are obtained 
from Lifeseeds and by equipping specific Charms. Lifeblood Masks from 
Lifesseds will disappear once you rest at a bench. Lifeblood Masks 
granted by Charms are restored every time you rest.SOULSOUL is measured 
by a cir cular meter found in the left corner of the screen, next to the 
Health Masks. SOUL is used by The Knight to cast Spells and to heal. 
Hitting enemies with the Nail is the primary source of regaining SOUL.The 
Knight Equipment and AbilitiesNailThe Nail is The  Knight's main weapon. 
It can be swung in four directions, damaging enemies, destroying 
breakable objects or bouncing off walls and spikes. Due to the knockback 
mechanic, the Bail can be used to traverse certain areas in Hallownest. 
You can choose to upgra de The Nail and learnNail ArtsfromNailmasters, 
unlocking new devastating moves.CharmsCharms are special items that can 
be found, gained as rewards or purchased from Merchants. Charms can be 
equipped on Charm Notches. They provide various buffs, including 
increased health, reduction of healing time, higher Nail damage and many 
more.SpellsSpells are skills that use SOUL. The Knight starts off with a 
single spell (Focus) and acquires more as they forge on - for example, 
theVengeful Spirit, granted by the Snail  Shaman. Spells can be upgraded to more potent versions, hidden in secret locations throughout 
Hallownest.AbilitiesAbilities are skills that do not use SOUL. They 
provide The Knight with new ways of traversing Hallownest's terrain and 
engaging in combat. T hey are granted by special items, such as Mothwing 
Cloak, Monarch Wings, and more.The Knight Gallery     In Hollow Knight,

 Lost Kin LocationAncient BasinHealth1200Reward400 EssenceLost Kin is a 
Boss in Hollow Knight. Bosses are special Ene miesthat feature their own 
arena, a large amount of health, and a variety of unique moves and 
abilities.You will need to perform multiple attacks such as using The 
Nail and Nail Arts along with theSpells and Abilitiesin order to defeat 
them. Some bosses ar e capable of entering into a state of stagger after 
landing a number of attacks on them.As soon as you encounter a boss,its 
name will appear on the screen, the music will change into a boss battle 
theme, and usually, pathsconnecting the arena will close or  will be 
blocked leaving you no choice but to face these devastating and unique 
foes.Lost Kin faces upwards lightly shaking; its head being weighed down 
by the sac of Lightseeds.Lost Kin LocationLocation: Ancient BasinAlso 
faced again during the Pantheon o f the Knight.Lost Kin RewardsRewards 
??Lost Kin StrategiesStrategy WriteupLost Kin combat is the faster and 
more aggressive version of Broken Vessel since it is its dream 
counterpart. The strategy for this boss is to stay close to it and spam 
it with hits.  It takes a while in between attacks, so it is recommended 
to hit it as much as possible, and heal yourself in between when you get 
a chance.Broken Vessel Charm suggestions:Charms: First you would want to 
consider havingQuick Focusequipped as it will help you recover your 
health quickly while trying to avoid and close in for attacks. Second, 
having a defensive charm such asThorns of Agony,Defender's Crest, orSpore 
Shroomwill work so that you can inflict damage even when taking damage, 
by running and jumping  inside the arena, or by using FOCUS. And finally, theGrubsongcharm. Since it is most likely that you will take damage from 
its annoying spawn ability, it would be better to have the Grubsong charm 
equipped so that you can recover SOUL while taking damage. Spells and 
Abilities: Whichever Spell you have acquired will help you with 
inflicting more damage on this boss. Spells likeVengeful SpiritorShade 
Soulwill definitely work with dealing damage from a distance especially 
if The Broken Vessel will performan at tack that requires it to channel or 
concentrate first.Desolate Diveis also a helpful spell where you can 
inflict damage while avoiding any projectile attack it has such as the 
constant spawn or releasing ofInfected Balloons. And of course, 
theMothwing Cloa korShade Cloakability will be your best friend in terms 
of constantly dashing and avoiding this boss' attacks. Note: if you are 
focused on using your Spells more rather than The Nail, make sure you 
have theShaman StoneandSpell Twistercharms equipped which will strengthen 
the damage of spells and reduce the SOUL cost of casting spells.Attacks & 
CountersAttackCounterPhase 1LeapAvoid/ Counter attack. This attack

Vessel was before it was infected. It was a vessel that managed to escape

 Lurien the Watcher   LocationWatcher's SpireLurien the Watcher is an 
NPCin Holl ow Knight. Lurien the Watcher is one of the three Dreamers 
andwas known as the "Watcher" of Hallownest.Lurien the Watcher 
InformationLurien the Watcher, who residesat the top of Watcher's Spirein 
the City of Tears,is the most loyal Dreamer to the Pale King . His title 
of "The Watcher" was given to him for constantly watching the City Of 
Tears though his telescope at the top of his spire. He is guarded by 
Watcher Knights, large armored beetles who werehis servants before they 
became Infected.At the top of the  Spire, Lurien s devoted butler, shown 
to be aCowardly Husk, remains guarding him, watching over his bed as he 
sleeps (though not much is known about the butler aside from Lurien 
mentioning him in his journal, which can be found and read in a hidden 
nook in the Spire). Lurien volunteered to become a Dreamer, and he shows 
a great admiration for the Pale King.Location: Lurien the Watcher Can be 
found at the top of Watcher's Spire in the City of TearsCombat:Players 
will need to strike his physical sleeping bod y with theDream Nailto enter 
the Dream World where they can find his vulnerable state which can be 
destroyed by The Nail and absorbed by using FOCUS.Rewards: Breaks their 
seal of theTemple of the Black Egg.Associated QuestsDream No 
MoreEachdreamer must be found to destroy the seal of theTemple of the 
Black Egg. Dialogue...For King beloved......To sleep. To serve......Bonds 
must remain......Remain...Notes & TipsLurien s insectoid species is 
unknown. He is the most enigmatic of the Dreamers, but the most loya l to 
the Pale King and Hallownest. His body shape, seen partly beneath his 
robes, is oddly reminiscent to that of aKingsmould.You can find and read 
some of Lurien s writings in a journal within a hidden nook at the top 
of the Watcher s Spire.Lurien s devoted butler, a timidCowardly Husk 
(also mentioned in Lurien s journal), still watches over him in his 
resting place in the Spire. The butler appears to be Infected due to his 
glowing eyes, but he is not hostile, and immediately runs away from the 
Knight. He remains there even after Lurien has been defeated.While his 
precise occupation is unknown, his title and the environmental clues at 
the Watcher's Spire suggest he was spying on the bugs of Hallownest for 
the Pale King.NPCsBardoon,Bretta,Brumm,Charm Lover

 Mantis Claw  Claw carved from bone. Allows the wearer to cling to walls 
and leap off them. FunctionGrants the ability to slide on walls and 
perform a Wall JumpLocationMantis VillageMantis Clawis an Abilityin 
Hollow Knight.Abilities areupgr ades which impart various effects and 
skills that help The Knight traverse and interact with the environment in 
new ways. Unlike Spells, Abilities do not use SOUL or any other 
resources, but some may have short cooldowns or require resetting before 
being available for use again. TheMantis Claw allows The Knightto cling 
to walls and other vertical surfaces, and perform Wall Jumpsto reach 
higher locations.Hollow Knight Mantis Claw Function & UsageThe Mantis 
Clawallows The Knighttoscale vertical surfaces such as walls and pillars, 
and is an essential Abilityfor exploration. To use it, jump towards a 
wall and continue holding the input towards its direction. A Wall Jumpcan 
then be performed by pressingJumpto launch theKnight diagonally away from 
the wall and cha in jumps to climb higher and higher.Wall Jumps can be chained an infinite number of times, allowing the Knight to climb up any 
walls they can reach.When the Knight clings to a wall, they slide down it 
at a slightly slower rate than their standard falling s peed.Clinging to 
walls resets the Knight's aerial dash ability imparted by the Mothwing 
Cloak, as well as the double jump ability from the Monarch Wings. Where 
these abilities can normally only be used once per jump, performing aWall 
Jump makes them availa ble once more, allowing the Knight to stay above 
ground and is the key to overcoming difficult platforming sections. This 
property also has its use in combat where walls are available to cling 
onto.How toObtain the Mantis Claw in Hollow KnightTheMantis Cla wis found 
in the Mantis Village, in the lower -central section of the Fungal 
Wastes.The Mothwing Cloakis required in order to reach the village, as 
well as the claw.Travel down the Fungal Wastesuntil you begin 
encountering Mantis -type enemies. Keep heading downwards until you 
seesome metallic poles wrapped with rope strewn about the area, and a 
single Mantis Warriorguarding an entrance to the left. This leads to the 
Mantis Village.After entering, keep heading in the same direction towards 
some buildings. Ign ore the path above and simply head all the way left at 
the ground level. At the end of the path is another Mantis 
Warriorguarding a switch on the ceiling. Hit the switch to unlock a door 
above you.Headback to the entrance of this area and jump to the platf orms 
above and follow them back to the door you unlocked. Carefully jump and 
dash into the opening that was blocked by the door and follow the path up 
and into a roomwith small shelves where the Mantis Claw can be 
found.Hollow Knight Mantis Claw Ability Mo difiersThe Mantis Claw does not

of old Hallownest had no love for each other . The Mantises outlived their 
rivals though, and their civilisation still stands.Mantis Lords 
LocationMantis VillageMantis Lords RewardsMark of PrideHallownest 
SealMantis Lords StrategiesStrategy WriteupMantis Lords are probably the 
quickest boss you'll en counter, they are an optional boss and the only 
way to fight them is if you challenge them. Once you choose to do so, the 
battle will begin with the first Mantis Lord. All of them have the same 
three attacks which are the Boomerang, Charge, and Overhead at tacks. The 
first mantis has more health compared to the other two, and once you've 
defeated the first mantis, the 2nd phase will begin where you'll fight the other two simultaneously.Their pattern is pretty easy to follow since 
whatever attack the 2nd mant is does, the first will follow (meaning their 
first move will be random but all the following moves will be synced). 
However, their speed and ability to teleport and dance around the arena 
is what will make the battle difficult.Recommended Charms: With Qui ck 
Focusequipped you'll regain health faster, meaning you can use smaller 
windows of opportunity. The best time to heal is when they use their 
boomerang attack. Grubsongis another helpful charm since you will most 
likely get hit by their attacks, especiall y in Phase 2. In the second 
phase, when the boomerangs fall straight down and off to the side, you 
can heal if you stand directly in the center, as the knight's hitbox is 
shrunk just enough that the boomerangs pass overhead.With Thorns of Agony 
you can dea l damage even after getting hit.If you are planning to use 
your spells often, be sure to have Shaman Stoneand Spell Twisterequipped 
to maximize the effects of your spells. Vengeful Spiritis best used when 
they cling onto the wall and telegraph their boomer ang attack 
whileDesolate Diveand Howling Wraithsis a nice counter whenever they 
perform the overhead attack. Desolate Dive can also be used to avoid 
damage whenever the mantis lords dash across the bottom while doing large 
damage.If you're having trouble b eating them with the Old Nail, make sure 
to upgrade it by visiting the Nailsmith. It's better if you finish this 
fight quickly, as healing in it can be difficult.Attacks & 
CountersAttackCounterPhase 1BoomerangWatch for the position of the 
Mantis, if it clu tches onto the lower part of the wall the projectile 
will start from the bottom and will rise up. If it positions itself onto 
the higher part of the wall, the projectile will start high and then to 
the bottom before it boomerangs back upCharge AttackOne of  the Mantis 
Lords will jump onto the platform and charge in to attack. This can be 
avoided by jumping on top, you'll have the time to jump since there will 
be a slight delay before it dashes.Overhead AttackDash away once one of 
the Mantis jumps above you a nd drops onto your position. There is also a 
slight delay before it actually drops down.Mantis Lords LoreThe Mantis 
Lords are unnamed mantisfly -like siblings of three who are the current 
leaders of the Mantis Tribe. Upon the spread of The Infection, they w ere 
able to resist and fight the plague all throughout the fall of the 
kingdom of Hallownest. The fourth sibling, the Traitor Lord, was exiled 
when he embraced the Infection.The Mantis Lords have kept order within 
their tribe even during The Infection and have killed any intruders who 
would try to break that order. After the Pale King took over Hallownest, 
the Mantis Tribe struck a deal that the The Pale Kingwould leave them be 
if the Mantis Tribe keptDeepnestout of the rest of the kingdom.A massive 
gateis presenton the border between the two areas as a border, and after 
you defeat the Lords, the gate will open.Mantis Lords Notes & 
TriviaUnlocks the "Respect" Trophy/Achievementafter defeating them.The

YouthMantis WarriorMantis Village WalkthroughThe Boundary of the 
VillageYou'll first arrive within the boundaries of the village where 
you'll first encounter a Mantis Warrior, be careful with its attack since 
it has quite a long reach when it swings its c law. Continue going east 
where you'll now encounter a Mantis Youth hanging like a bat on the 
ceiling, once you're within its range, it will start to fly and swoop in 
to attack you, continue going east where another Mantis Warrior is 
blocking your path.Towr adsthe end, there is a locked door, but you can 
drop down and then head clockwise where you'll find an intersection 
leading down - drop down to enter the next section.Acquiring the 
Dashmaster CharmFrom here, head down southeast, then southwest, then 
southeast again which will lead you towards the path to a Bench. Just be 
careful going down and always try to look below you to check if there are 
only a few platforms for you to jump on to avoid falling into the pool of 
acid.From the bench, head west into the n ext section where you'll see a 
shivering bug to your left. That bug is Bretta, and you'll have to save her later when you acquire the Mantis Clawability. For now, head to the 
very bottom part of the cavern to find a statue of a warrior and the 
Dashmasterch arm just next to it - obtain it and head back to the previous 
section.Into the Mantis VillageOnce you're back, we'll go through a few 
parts of the section before heading into the village. First, jump on the 
platforms and stay to the left where you'll see a  Mantis Youth, just pass 
it, you'll find a cluster of Geo that you can destroy to obtain Geo. 
Second head back down and use the mushroom to pogo off it and proceed 
east, then head up on the platforms until you reach the surface where 
you'll encounter 1x Ma ntis Youthalongside 1x Mantis Warrior, kill both 
the enemies to reach 2 more caches of Geo. Continue heading up one level 
and proceed west where you'll find another Mantis Warriorblocking the 
path leading to the village - kill it and enter the next 
section.Acquiring the Mantis ClawFrom here, head all the way to the 
western end until you reach the switch that is on the ceiling. You'll 
encounter more Mantis Youth and Mantis Warrior as you walk down the path. 
After activating the switch, retrace your steps and  jump onto the 
platform that will take you to the 2nd level of the section.Another 
Mantis Warriorwill be blocking your way and a Mantis Youthby the large 
gap, kill it to regain SOUL and to clear your path. Once they're dead, 
jump and dash to reach the othe r end to your left and just continue 
heading west until you see shelves full of Mantis Claws just above The 
Knight. Jump up on the platforms, kill the Mantis Youthalong the way and 
jump down into the room with the shelves where you can pick up the Mantis 
Claw- with the Mantis Claw, you can now cling onto walls to either reach 
higher ground or to slide down safely. You can test the ability out by 
going up one level, and perform a wall jump to your right to reach 2 
caches of Geo.Finding the Mantis LordsFrom w here you acquired the Mantis 
Claw, you'll want togo back down then proceed northeast where you'll find 
a spiked pit. Make sure to cling onto the wall and the dash towards the 
platform to avoid falling into the pit. Continue heading east and then 
clockwise to find a switch, hit it to open the gate in front of you as 
well as a big gate that will open on the lower part of the room. Before 
heading down, you'll find a cluster of Geo just across the gate in front 
of you. Collect the Geo and head down into the nex t section below.Now, 
you'll find more spikes on the ground and walls alongside Mantis 
Youthenemies that will follow you around once you are seen. Most of the 
gates are locked that has a switch that you can use to open it, so you'll 
want to head northwest a nd make your way down counterclockwise. 
Eventually, you'll come across the switches to unlock the gates and at 
the end will be a path that you'll drop down into leading to the Mantis 
Lords.Boss Battle, Mantis LordsTo start the boss battle, walk up to the 
middle and interact to challenge them. This boss battle has two phases, 
the first is where you'll fight one of the mantis then upon defeating it, 
you'll enter phase 2 where you'll now fight the other two. You can click 
hereto learn more about the strategies  on how to defeat them. Upon 
defeating them you'll be considered as the new lord of the Mantis Village 
which will cause all the inhabitants in the village to become passive. 
Now, the door to their left will lead you to Deepnest, which you will 
enter later on.Claim your RewardsFrom the arena of the Mantis Lords, 
climb back up and head northeast where you'll find Mantis Warrior. You'll 
notice that they are no longer hostile and will now start to bow down to 
you when you approach them. Continue climbing up the  wall until you reach 
the switch - open the gate by activating the switch then go east into the next section.If you went here earlier, you'll find that you won't be able 
to enter further since the Mantis Warrior will hit the switch if you try 
to enter. But  now that you've defeated the Mantis Lords, the Mantis by 
the switch will now bow down to you, allowing you to proceed further 
inside the room.If you continue heading east, you'll find a bench that 
you can rest on and save your game. When you're done, head  back and jump 
onto the 2nd level with the spikes to find a chest on the 3rd level, 
cling onto the wall and jump -dash to reach it. You'll be able to acquire 
the Mark of Pride charm inside the chest. Now head back down and climb 
the wall opposite to where t he Mantis Warrior is and head to the top to 
find another chest containing 1x Hallownest Seal. From the chest, head 
east and slide down the wall to the left side then dash towards the 
treasure room to your right to find another chest containing lots of 
Geo.Once you're done, head back down to the bench to save your game and 
replenish your health. This marks the completion for the Mantis Village, 
up next is the City of Tears.Video[video goes here]MapClick on the image

 Massive Moss Charger LocationGreenpathHealth100Reward300Massive Moss 
Charger is a Boss in Hollow Knight. Bosses are special Enemiesthat 
feature their own arena, a large amount of health, and a variety of 
unique moves and abilities.You will need to perform multiple attacks such 
as using The Nail and Nail Arts along with theSpells and Abilitiesin 
order to defeat them. Some bosses are capable of  entering into a state of 
stagger after landing a number of attacks on them.As soon as you 
encounter a boss,its name will appear on the screen, the music will 
change into a boss battle theme, and usually, pathsconnecting the arena 
will close or will be blo cked leaving you no choice but to face these 
devastating and unique foes.Family of creatures that have learnt to bulk 
up with moss and live as one.There is strength in numbers, yes, but these 
creatures never had much strength to begin with. Cut through the ir 
trickery.Massive Moss Charger LocationGreenpathMassive Moss Charger 
Rewards300Massive Moss Charger StrategiesStrategy WriteupThe Massive Moss 
Charger is an easy battle that can be dealt with immediately. It only has 
two attacks which are a charge attack  and a leaping attack. It will 
always start off with burrowing underneath the ground and will emerge 
after a brief moment and will follow up with either of the attacks. Just 
keep in mind to standand stay in the middle of the arena and wait for it 
to emerge  since it will always keep its distance before it attacks. If it 
charges in, quickly jump and perform a downward attack, if it leaps into 
the air, execute a dash towards the opposite direction and retaliate for 
an attack.You could use your spells and other  charms here if you choose 
to do so, but having the Quick Slashcharm equipped and upgrading The Nail 
is enough to defeat this boss.Attacks & CountersAttackCounterPhase 
1Charge AttackSimilar to a regularMoss Charger, it will emerge from the 
ground and will charge towards The Knight and will burrow itself back 
into the ground. It can simply be avoided by jumping over it.Leap and 
FlopInstead of charging in for an attack, this massive moss charger can 
leap into the air right after emerging from the ground and w ill land on 
its belly for a belly -flop that deals damage upon contact. It is 
recommended to not jump but instead dash towards the opposite direction 
as it leaps into the air.Massive Moss Charger LoreThis Massive Moss Charger is revealed to be a combination  of 3 regular Moss Chargers all 
merged into one.Massive Moss Charger Notes & TriviaThe Massive Moss

an arachnoid being and a former servant of Deepn est who claims to have 
the answers to The Knight's questions.Midwife InformationMidwife is a long-bodied black arachnoid being that emerges from a wall in a chamber 
of Deepnest. As her name implies, she was a servant and midwife of Herrah 
and Deepnest. She  claims that she can provide information that The Knight 
is looking for, but later on opens up her mask, revealing a mouth filled 
with sharp fangs, and attempts to attack and devour The Knight. She 
doesn't take any damage from being hit, but she does infli ct damage on 
The Knight if you are caught in her attack - attacking her once will 
cause her to shrink back into her wall. She will re -appear after re -
entering the area, coyly apologizing for her appetite, but will state 
she's still hungry. If The Knight go es to her once more, she will 
compliment them, calling them a caring host, but still attacks them. 
Further attempts to talk to her will result in the third dialogue being 
repeated, and once again she will attack.Midwife is an NPC who can tell 
when the Knig ht is reading her thoughts with the Dream Nail. When the 
Dream Nail is used on Midwife, she will defensively scream at them to get 
out of her head. Though she provides the Knight with some history 
regarding Deepnest, her seemingly gentle and calm facade is  a deceptionin 
order to lure the Knight so she can get a meal.Location: Midwife Can be 
found behind a breakable wall at the end of a corridor at the bottom 
right exit of the Distant Village.Combat: Players may not kill

The maximum amount The Knight can deposit is4500, however, something 
special will happen if you deposit an amount more than2500. Deposit any 
amount for than2500, rest at any bench or use fast tra vel, and return to 
her stand - you will be surprised that Millibelle has abandoned her stand and will reveal that the stand is fake and made out of cardboard if you 
strike it a couple of times with The Nail.Now, it may seem that you have 
wasted such a huge  amount of money, but you will be able to gain whatever 
amount you have deposited with a large interest rate by tracking 
Millibelle down. Simply head over to the Pleasure Housein the City of

of your Geo and the reason why she had to leave. After you've listened to 
her plea, you will now have the opportunity to recover your Geo by 
striking her shell with the Nail, she will immediately hide in her shell 
like a turtle, and as you continuously strike her shell, countless Geo 
will start to drop.Hitting her shell won't inflict any damage or kill her 
but will just bounce her around the area - Geo will stop falling off from 
her shell which implies that all of the Geo you've deposited as well as 
more have  completely fallen out of her shell, with this you can leave the 
area or head back to the hot spring and speak to her where she mentions 
that "she has nothing left and suggest for you to be on your way". You 
may strike her shell and bounce her around the area without inflicting 
any damage if you simply would like to play around with her.Millibelle

 Monarch Wings  Wings of ethereal matter that shimmer in the 
darkness .Allows one to jump again in mid -air. FunctionDouble 
JumpLocationAncient BasinMonarch Wingsis an Abilityin Hollow 
Knight.Abilities areupgrades which impart various effects and skills that 
help The Knight traverse and interact with the environment in new wa ys. 
Unlike Spells, Abilities do not use SOUL or any other resources, but some 
may have short cooldowns or require resetting before being available for 
use again. TheMonarch Wingsenable a second jump while in mid -air, 
allowing the Knight to reach greater he ights and cross larger gaps that a 
single jump cannot accomplish.Hollow Knight Monarch Wings Function & 
UsageThe Monarch Wings impart the Double Jump ability to The Knight, 
allowing them to perform a second jump while in mid -air.Double Jump has a 
longer ho rizontal range than theJump +Dash (Mothwing Cloak) combo. Using 
all three abilities in conjunction allows The Knight to travel even 
further.Similar to the Dash, theDouble Jump can normally only be 
performed once per standard Jump, but it is reset whenever the Knight 
lands on the ground or a platform, clings to or jumps off of vertical 
surfaces with the Mantis Claw,as well as after bouncing off of an enemy 
or object using the Nail'sDown Strike.How toObtain the Monarch Wings in 
Hollow KnightTheMonarch Wings a re found in the western section of the 
Ancient Basin.The Crystal Heartis required to reach theMonarch Wings' 
location. The Lumafly Lanternis also recommended to illuminate dark 
sections along the path.From the Ancient Basin's tram station, make your 
way down to the middle section of the map and then head west. In the area 
with the Bench, there is a huge gap that requires the Super Dash to 
cross. Keep following the path westwards and you will eventually come 
across the Broken Vesselboss encounter. Defeat it to gain access to the 
following area where you can collect the Monarch Wings.Hollow Knight 
Monarch Wings Notes & TipsTheMonarch Wings are technically not required 
to complete the game, but they do allow access to the Palace Grounds, the 
White PalaceandThe Fungal Corelocations, as well as the Enraged 
Guardianboss encounter. Other locations that seemingly require theMonarch 
Wings to reach can be accessed with some clever platforming using the 
other abilities andPogo -jumping off of enemies and objects. However , 
theMonarch Wings provide a huge quality of life ability that is useful in 
both exploration and combat.Collecting the Monarch Wings stops the strong 
gusts of wind that can be witnessed in several sections of the Ancient 
Basin. This implies that the winds are caused by the wings.Obtaining the 
Monarch Wings is one of the two triggers that will cause The Infection to 
spreadacross theForgotten Crossroads, with the other being the death of 
any of the Dreamers.   All Abilities in Hollow KnightAwoken Dream

 Mothwing Cloak  Cloak threaded with mothwing strands. Allows the wearer 
to dash forwards along the ground or through the air. FunctionDash on the 
ground or through the air.LocationGreenpathMothwing Cloakis an Abilityin Hollow Knight.Abilities areupgrades which impart various effects and 
skills that help The Knight traverse and interact with the environment in 
new ways. Unlike Spells, Abilities do not use SOUL or any other 
resources, but some may have short cooldowns or require resetting before 
being available for use again. The Mothwing Cloak allows the Knight to 
dashin the dire ction they are facing both on the ground and in the 
air.Hollow Knight Mothwing Cloak Function & UsageThe Mothwing Cloak 
imparts the Dash ability to The Knight. This is one of the most essential 
Abilitiesthat the Knight can obtain, allowing them to quickly dash 
forwards a short distance and reach platforms that are normally 
inaccessible with just the basic jump. Dashing is also a key skill for 
avoiding damage in combat. It is used simply by pressing the Dash 
button/key.TheMothwing Cloak dash has a cooldown o f0.6 seconds. This 
cooldown only applies to dashes on the ground.The Knight can also dash 
while in mid -air, allowing them to cover even greater horizontal 
distance. This mid -air dash can normally only be performed once and is 
not affected by the ability's cooldown, but it is reset when the Knight 
lands on the ground or a platform, clings to or jumps off vertical 
surfaces with the Mantis Claw, as well as after bouncing off of an enemy 
or object using the Nail's Down Strike.Dashing through an enemy, their 
attacks or projectiles is normally not possible with just theMothwing 
Cloakalone and the Knight willreceivedamage when doing so. However, this 
property is granted by the Shade Cloakupgrade.How toObtain the Mothwing 
Cloak in Hollow KnightTheMothwing Cloak can be found on the body of a 
Vesselin Hornet's boss arena in Greenpathafter defeating her.Hollow 
Knight Mothwing Cloak Ability ModifiersTheMothwing Cloak and its effects 
can be modified with the following:DashmasterCharm - Reduces the dash's 
cooldown from0.6 seconds to0.4 seconds. Note that this only affects 
dashes along the ground. The charm also allows the Knight to dash 
downwards while in mid -air.Shade Cloak - An upgrade that supplements the 
dash ability by protecting the Knight from harm while dashing, allo wing 
them to dash through enemies, their attacks and projectiles. This ability 
has an internal cooldown independent of the dash's cooldown. Also allows 
the Knight to dash throughShade Gates found in different locations across 
Hallownest.Hollow Knight Mothw ing Cloak Notes & TipsIf the Knight leaves 
a platform by dashing offits edge, their mid -air dash charge is not 
consumed and they cantechnically perform another mid -air dash right 
after. This is also true if the Knight isclingingonto a wall or vertical 
surface with the Mantis Claw and they dash off of it instead of jumping. 
However, this has limited applications in platforming as the dash has a 
shorter range than the standard jump, but it may have practical uses in 
combat.   All Abilities in Hollow KnightAwo ken Dream Nail,Crystal

 Myla   LocationForgotten CrossroadsMyla is an NPCin Hollow Knight. Myla 
is a cheerful miner bug who enjoys singing dirges and is keen on fin ding 
treasure.Myla InformationMyla is a miner bug who is identical to the 
Infected Husk Miners found working in Crystal Peak - yet she does not 
appear to be Infected and seems to still have her sanity and sapience. 
She also does not have a sinister telltal e orange glow in her eyes. She 
has a bit of a stutter when she talks. Shecan be encountered near the 
entrance to Crystal Peak in the Forgotten Crossroads, mining and joyfully 
singing dirges. Myla possesses a gleeful, optimistic personality, is very friendly toward the Knight, and enjoys their company, wanting them to 
sing and mine for treasures with her.After the Knigh t acquires 
theVengeful Spirit and Desolate Dive , Myla s personality gradually 
changes; she loses her joyous aura. She will eventually stop m ining with 
her pickaxe and just stand still and stare, her voice shaky and 
sorrowful -sounding as she tries and struggles to continue singing. It 
sounds as if she is crying at this point.After the Knight claims the 
Crystal Heart, Myla completely succumbs to  The Infection and turns into 
another infected Husk Miner, like her family she had sung of in her 
dirges, and she will attack the Knight in a hostile, zombified state if 
approached. Unlike other Husk Miners, she will cry out in deep sorrow if 
struck and ki lled (and will drop10).There is no way to spare Myla from 
becoming Infected; however, you are not required to kill her.Location: 
Myla can be found at the Forgotten Crossroads, near the entrance to 
Crystal Peak.Combat: Players may kill Myla (when she become s 
Infected).Rewards: Killing her once she is infected drops10.Associated

TheNail in Hollow Knightis the traditional weapon of the denizens of 
Hallownest. TheNail is a bladed weaponused by The Knight, the game's 
protagonist,as the primary means of dealing damagein Combat. It can a lso 
be seen wielded by some Enemies, Bossesand NPCs. Typically used much like 
a sword, theNail is a versatile weapon with which a practitioner can use 
slashing strikes to get the better of one's opponents. The Knight'sNail 
can be upgraded a number of times  after locating the Nailsmithand 
providing him with the necessary resources in order to increase damage 
output. Powerful techniques known as Nail Artscan also be learned from 
Nailmasters, experts in Nail combat,offering different ways to approach 
battles.H ollow Knight Nail Combat Mechanics OverviewInHoll ow Knight,The 
Knight's attack moveset is comprised of seemingly very basic slasheswith 
theNail, allowing himto deal damage and defeat his opponents. Despite 
their simplicity, these attacks arevery responsive  and snappy, 
contributing to the game's highly nuanced and precise combat mechanics 
that demand mastery of The Knight and his Nail's fundamentals.Basic 
SlashThe Knight's bread & butter move is the standard slash attack 
performed on the ground. It hits dire ctly in front of the Knight, in whicheverdirection he is facing. Fast and efficient, this move actually 
has two animations:  an up swing and a down swing which can be chained 
indefinitely. Its range and speed can be improved with certain 
Charmcombinations . The arc of the swing can hit opponents that are 
slightly higher or lower than the knight, and this arc's size and hitbox 
can also be improved with charms.The Knight can also slash while in the 
air.Upward SlashThe Upward Slash is a basic slash that can pr ove 
invaluable for hitting opponents above the Knight. It is performed by 
attacking while pressing up on the analog stick or D -pad. Just like the 
standard slash, it can also be performed while in the air and while its 
swing arc is more vertical, it can sti ll hit targets that are on either 
side of the Knight, especially when range Charmsare equipped.Down 
StrikeThe Down Strike can be performed by attacking while pressing down 
on the analog stick or D -pad whilst in the air. This is a very versatile 
move that n ot only allows the Knight to deal damage while jumping over 
enemies, but also allows him to bounce off ofthem and redirect himself to 
safety. When timed properly, the Knight can perform bounces on enemies 
indefinitely which allows for various strategies in  combat. The Down 
Strike also has applications in the exploration and platforming aspects 
of the game.These three attacks with the Nailmake up the basis forHollow 
Knight's combat and give way to more complex mechanics. The Knightwill 
also gain access to Sp ellsand other abilities which he can weave in with 
these three fundamental attacks, while supplemented with the proper 
Charmcombinations in order to best the toughest Enemiesand Bosses.The 
Knight can also use theNail to perform more advanced techniques 
pertaining to combat and exploration:Charging the Soul GaugeEvery attack 
successfully landed on opponents will fill up the Soul Gauge, depicted as 
a large mask -like icon next to your health masks in the top left of the 
HUD. This gauge fuels your Spells. Each of the Knight's Spells use a 
portion of this gauge and can be cast as long as the gauge is 
sufficiently filled, indicated by its white color. This gauge is also 
used for healing via the FocusSpell.Parrying AttacksThe Parry is a highly 
advanced combat move that the Knight can perform by timing his swings to 
collide with the attacks of opponents. This will result in a bright flash 
as the Nail deflects the attack, rendering the Knight invulnerable for a 
few short frames. Every single one of the Knight's basic attacks can 
deflect, whether performed on the ground or in the air and nearly every 
attack can be parried, including those of Bosses. Skillful use of the 
parry is rewarded by negating damage from the most deadly attacks, while 
allowing the Knight to weave in counters of his own.Pogo JumpsUsing the 
Down Strike, The Knight can "Pogo Jump" off of enemies, as well as 
breakable objects in the environment such as jars and lamps.This is a 
very important technique not only for combat, but for exploration and 
platforming as well, allowing the Knight to get to ledges and paths that 
would otherwise be out -of-reach. Some objects in the environment such as 
the purple mushrooms in the Fungal Wastescan be used to jump even higher 
by using the Pogo Jump technique. Furthermo re, it can be used to traverse 
hazardous sections of the environment such as long stretches of thorns or 
spike pits that would normally deal heavy damage to the Knight on 
contact.All Nail Upgrades in Hollow KnightThe Nail in Hollow Knight can 
be upgraded a  total of 4 times by locating the Nailsmithin the City of 
Tears. The Nailsmith is a craftsman who survived the fall of 
Hallownestthrough his sheer obsession with his craft. Often working in 
seclusion and with little care for the world around him, the Nails mith is fully dedicated to his hopes of one day forging the most powerful of 
Nails. Upon meeting him, you can commission him to upgrade your Nail in 
exchange for Geoand Pale Ore.The firstupgrade requires Geo only, but 
every upgrade thereafter will also req uire Pale Ore, a rare resource that 
will require thorough exploration to obtain. Each subsequent upgrade will 
require more of these resources.Each Nail upgrade increases its damage 
output which can further be modified by equipping certain Charms.Each 
Nail upgrade also changes the weapon's name, as well as its appearance. 
However, the appearance change is only visible in the equipment menu. Old

LocationFirst encounte r: DeepnestThe location of Nosk is hidden, so 
first, acquire Monarch Wings or Crystal Heartin order to reach the area. 
Directly left of the Hot Spring in Deepnest, there is a secret area where 
a Grub can be found, break the wall behind the Grub to discover  a tunnel 
that leads into the lair of this shape -shifting creature. Second 
encounter in its Winged Form: GodhomeNosk RewardsPale OreNosk 
StrategiesStrategy WriteupNosk is an unpredictable boss, as it is able to 
move fast within its lair and quickly mix up its attacks. First, 
let'sidentify whichCharmsyou should have equipped. Quick Focusis a must 
in order for The Knight to use healing as quickly as possible in order to 
keep up with Nosk's pace. Thorns of Agony, this charm is helpful in terms 
of dealing chip damage, since most likely you will get hit by Nosk's fast 
attacks, executing a counter -attack for getting hit is a wise thing to do 
in order to be consistent with dealing damage. Quick Slashcan also be 
used if you want to be aggressive and face this boss h ead-on, having this 
charm will allow you to land your basic attacks as fast and frequently as 
you can when the opportunity is available.Now, there is a way for you to 
avoid some of its attacks. The arena has a middle platform where a wall 
from both directi ons can be found, however, at the left side of the 
middle platform, you will notice that the wall is higher compared to the 
right-hand side. If you hug the left side of the wall of the lower 
platform, you can avoid some of its attacks like the running and leap attack, but the eruption or rain of infection will not work here since it 
most likely covers the arena and tracks the movement of The Knight. Use 
this spot to avoid his running and leap attack as well as for healing. If 
you continue to hug the wall, y ou can also use the opportunity to strike 
upwards in order to land attacks while it runs in between the gap.Be sure 
to upgrade your Mothwing Cloak ability to the Shade Cloaksince 99.9% of 
the time you will need to phase through Nosk in order to evade its 
attacks. If the Shade Cloak is in cooldown, having Monarch Wingswill also 
be helpful since you can jump high enough to evade it and also land a 
couple of downward strikes on top of Nosk. Take your time, watch its 
movement, upgrade your equipment, and utiliz e the spot in order to defeat 
this challenging boss.Attacks & CountersAttackCounterPhase 1Running 
AttackNosk begins this attack by standing tall and emitting a screech, 
followed by returning back to its hunching position to run in for a 
charged attack. Nos k will not stop if it hits The Knight or a wall since 
it will completely run around its arena, make sure to have Mothwing Cloak 
or better yet Shade Cloak in order to phase through it.Eruption of 
InfectionNosk will release blobs of infection near its feet a nd the rest 
across the arena. It will usually stop in the middle of the arena to 
perform this attack and while it executes the attack it is best to take 
cover using the gap or the wall that separates the middle platform and 
the rest of the arena. The blobs  will remain in the arena for a short 
while and disperse afterward.Leap AttackNosk will constantly leap around 
its lair up to 3 times as its way to move around and sometimes to jump in 
towards The Knight to deal damage. Keeping your distance and having the  
Mothwing Cloak or Shade Cloak ability will be helpful to dodge it in case 
it chases or decides to land on The Knight.Barrage of InfectionThis 
attack will have Nosk leap into the ceiling and will drop blobs of 
infection on The Knight. It takes about a seco nd to drop one blob after 
the other and the Nosk will remain hidden for about 6 seconds. The only 
way to avoid damage from this attack is to watch the ceiling for its 
movement, dust will start to form on the ceiling to know where the blob 
will fall and whe re Nosk will eventually drop from. Run towards the 
opposite direction of where the blobs will drop and if you get cornered 
jump and dash away to get more space.Nosk LoreNosk is a shape -shifting 
creature who uses its ability to lure its victims into its lai r. It can 
mimic the image or shape faces and contort its body into any shape of a 
bug from a memory of its victim. Nosk usually mimics the image of its 
victim's loved or departed ones in order to either kill or eat them - 
Nosk remains a mysterious foe and doesn't have any thoughts but only to 
kill.Nosk Notes & TriviaUpon defeat, Nosk drops the same shell that The 
Knight drops upon death.A winged variation is introduced in the Godmaster

that wonderful, charming aura about you. The whole town feels brighter 
for it.Before you hurry about your business, I've a small gift to

Oblobble LocationColosseum of FoolsTrial of the Conqueror Oblobble 
RewardsRewards ??Oblobble StrategiesStrategy WriteupAs soon as you start 
this battle, you will be faced  with two Oblobbles. Simply focus on one 
Obbloble first and try to follow it if it switches places with the other. 
They are quite slow in movement. Their main attack is shooting multiple 
acid blobs. The acid blobs shoot out in a circle in rapid succession.  
Whenever it executes the attack, it will remain in its position and takes 
about 2-3 seconds long before it stops and flies around and towards 
another spot. Taking your time is wise and focusing on the direction of 
the blobs is recommended in order to avoi d any damage and after it 
executes the attack, you can quickly dive in to attack while it flies 
around. However, if you want to be aggressive, using ranged Spells like 
Vengeful Spirit, Shade Soul, or equipping charms that will increase the 
range of the Nai l will allow you to consistently deal damage and kill one 
of the Oblobbles.Once one of the Obblebes die, the other will enter a frenzied state where it will acquire a boost of health and an increase of 
movement and attacks. Again, using your spells in this  battle will 
quickly get the job done, so having Charms that add buffs to The Knight's 
spells such as Shaman Stoneor Spell Twisterwill help.Attacks & 
CountersAttackCounterPhase 1Acid SprayThe main and only attack of the 
Oblobble is where it shoots multiple  small blobs of acid around its body. 
It's a matter of watching the direction of the blobs and avoiding it with 
the right spacing in order to evade it. While the Oblobbles telegraph 
this attack, they will not move and remain in their position.FlyOblobbles 
will fly continuously after executing their main attack. They fly slow 
but bounces off walls and deal damage upon contact. Keep your distance 
and try to use offensive Spells or charms that grant The Knight an 
increase of range for its basic attacks for a s afe play.Phase 2Frenzy 
StateIf one of the Oblobbles dies, the other will enter into a frenzied 
state. It does not obtain additional attacks but has a health boost and 
increased speed for its movements and attacks. Usage of spells from a 
distance will do th e trick to quickly eliminate it.Oblobble LoreThe 
Oblobbles are larger variants of the Oblobble species.They were isolated 
and raised within the Colosseum to take part in the battle against the 
gladiators. As the Hunter's Journal suggests, they are life -long mates 
and are fiercely attached to one another. This is likely the reason why, 
after one of them is killed, the other will be frenzied.Oblobble Notes &

are used in a similar fashion, with slashing strikes forming the basis of 
their attacks.Nails are prevalent in Hallownest and are used by its 
guards, soldiers and other warriors. Nails can be seen wielded by various 
Enemies, Bosses and NPCs that The Knight encounters. The denizens of 
Hallownest also wield other weapons that appear to be variations of the 
Nail such as the Mantis Lords' spears and H ornet's Needle.The Old Nail 
appears to have large cracks in its blade and handle in the equipment 
menu, indicating its disuse and lack of care given. While Nail 
appearances change in the menu as you upgrade them, these changes are not

Artist Paintmaster Sh eo RewardsRewards ??Paintmaster Sheo 
StrategiesStrategy WriteupPaintmaster Sheo is fought in Godhomeand appear 
as the final boss in the Pantheon of the Artist. Sheo's attacks can be 
evaded easily since similar to his fellow Nailmasters, Sheo needs to 
charge before releasing an attack and has a bit of a slow animation which 
allows players to predict its movements. An attack that is recommended to 
watch out for is Great Slashand the Lunge Attack since both have quite a 
long range that is enough to reach The K night.Sheo can be staggered which 
you can use to either heal or go on the offense and bombard him with 
attacks. Your spells can be handy in this battle since you will be 
dancing around the arena to try and evade Sheo's long -range attacks, 
spells such as Sh ade Soul, Abyss Shriek, andDescending Darkwill allow you 
to deal damage in all ranges and direction Sheo tries to move around - 
just be sure to have Shaman Stoneand Spell Twisterto increase the overall 
effectiveness of your spells, Soul Eateris also best p aired with to 
increase the number of SOULS replenished from landing basic attacks.Attacks & CountersAttackCounterPhase 1Painter's LungeSheo will 
start to raise his brush and lunges it like a spear. This creates a 
yellow colored javelin paint that has a lon g range. You can either dash 
away from this attack or jump above before he releases the attack. Sheo's 
paintbrush turns into yellow when he executes this attackPainter's 
LeapSimilar to the Brothers Oro and Mato's leap attack, Sheo first leaps 
into the air,  releases red paint in a parabolic angle and finishes the 
move with stomping onto the ground. Since the attack is fast, you can 
bait out Sheo to jump at one end of the arena by running and standing at 
the end. Wait for him to jump on top of you and quickly  dash towards the 
opposite end to give you space to avoid the projectiles. Sheo's 
paintbrush turns into red when he executes this attack.Splash of 
PaintSheo swings his paintbrush onto the ground, causing three blobs of 
blue paint to shoot out of Sheo's wea pon in front of him. One low, mid, 
high blobs of paint travel once Sheo swings his paintbrush. Keep your 
distance and try to dash instead of jumping to avoid the mid and high 
projectiles. Sheo's paintbrush turns into blue whenever he executes this 
attack.G reat SlashSheo performs his signature Nail Art, Great Slash. 
Sheo's paintbrush turns into Magenta and a white aura will engulf Sheo 
for players to identify that this attack is being telegraphed. If you 
want to play offensively, you can dash and phase throu gh the attack and 
follow up with an attack but if you want to play defensively, simply keep 
your distance and do not stand close since Sheo releases a column of 
paint in front of him that has a long range.Paintmaster Sheo 
LorePaintmaster Sheo is the the st rongest and mightiest amongst the trio 
Nailmasters. I'm his youth Sheo was taken under the supervision of the 
Great NailsageSly, who nurtured and trained him and hisbrothers Oro and

isGreat Slashand the Lunge Attack since both h ave quite a long range that 
is enough to reach The Knight.Sheo can be staggered which you can use to 
either heal or go on the offense and bombard him with attacks. Your

your trial time. Clearing this Pantheon will unlock theAchievement: 
Brotherhood.Brothers Oro and MatoBrothers Oro and Mat o are the 
FinalBossesof thePantheon of the Master. Once you start the battle, 
you'll first face off with Oro - Oro fights with three of his attacks, 
the Double Slash, Leap Attack, and his signature Nail Art:Dash Slash. Fighting Oro alone is quite easy sinc e you can dodge most of his attacks 
and you can predict where he will land whenever he performs the leap 
attack. Just be careful of his Dash Slash because this attack allows him 
to dash towards The Knight where he covers most of the arena, so always 
remember to time your jumps or dash/phase through him.After dealing with 
400 damage, Mato jumps in the arena and fights alongside his brother. 
This is where it gets tricky, Mato's attacks are similar to Oro, the only 
difference is that Mato uses his own signatur e move,Cyclone Slash, and 
has a shorter cooldown allowing him to quickly recover and telegraph 
another attack. Another thing to take note off is that they also fight 
defensively where they block The Knight's basic attacks with their 
Nail.Timing your dodges  and attacks will be a bit easy for you since most 
of their attacks require them to charge for a brief moment. If they 
perform their Nail Art attack, they have about a second before they 
actually release the attack. If they try to jump for a leap attack, t hey 
stop midair allowing you to predict where they will land and also giving 
you the window to dodge or perfect your spacing to dodge and attack at 
the same time.Being aggressive here is also a fun tactic since the 
brothers tend to stick to each other, you  can spam them with your Spells 
by usingShade SoulorVenegeful Spiritallowing you to attack both of them. 
If they try to leap into the air an assurance of landing damage can be 
dealt with by usingAbyss ShriekorHowling Wraiths - just be mindful that if 
you plan on using your Spells more often to equipShaman StoneandSpell 
Twisterto increase the effectiveness of your spells.At some point, there 
will be moments in the battle where you get cornered and the only way to 
dodge is to dash. If you have theShade Cloakor Mothwing Cloakability, be 
sure to haveSharp Shadowequipped so that you can deal damage and evade at 
the same time.The next Challenge gate will be directly next to the 
Pantheon of the Master: Pantheon of the Artist.

Nailsage SlyGreat Nailsage SlyThe Great Nailsage Sly is qu ite a difficult 
and tricky boss. Compared to the others, he is faster and has a shorter recovery rate of executing one attack after the other. Sly can be fought 
inGodhomeand appear as the final boss in thePantheon of the Sage. It is 
recommended that you re ly on your Spells or Charms that provide long -
range effects or buffs. So first, let's talk about the Charms.Quick 
Focusis a must to have equipped since Sly will not stop and will only 
give you little time or an opportunity to recover your health. So having  
this charm can help you recover health at a faster rate. Maintaining a 
safe space between you and Sly will be important, so in conjunction with 
that, make sure to haveMark of Prideto increase the range of the Nail 
allowing you to strike and be safe from a  distance.Quick Slashis also 
helpful so that you can strike at even a faster rate.Spells,Shade 
SoulorVengeful Spiritwill most likely work here,Abyss ShriekorDescending 
Darkisn't recommended since Sly constantly dances around the arena and 
you'll most likel y miss. The reason why Shade Soul or Vengeful Spirit can 
work since it can be executed fast and can guarantee that it will hit 
Sly. But of course, if you plan on using your spells more often than The 
Nail, you must have the following charms equipped that c an buff the 
overall effectiveness of your Spells -Shaman Stoneto increase the effect 
of the spells,Spell Twisterto reduce the SOUL required whenever you cast 
a spell, andSoul CatcherorSoul Eaterto increase the amount of SOUL gained 
from striking the enemy with The Nail.Keep your distance at all times, 
use long -range attacks, take your time, and use the opportunity to strike 
Sly whenever he falls onto the ground after performing an aerial 
attack.Clearing this battle will reveal your trial time. Clearing this

difference is that Mato uses his own signature move,Cyclone Slash, and 
has a shorter cooldown allowing him to quickly recover and telegraph 
another attack. Another thing to take note off is that they also fight 
defensively where they block The Knight's basic attacks with their 
Nail.Timing your dodges and attacks will be a bit easy for you since most 
of their attacks require them to charge for a brief moment. If they 
perform their Nail Art attack, they have about a second before they 
actually release the attack. If they try to jump for a leap attack, they 
stop midair allowing you to predict where they will land and also giving 
you the window to dodge or perfect your spacing to dodge and attack at 
the same time.Being aggressive here is also a fun tactic since the 
brothers tend to stick to each other, you can spam them with your Spells 
by usingShade SoulorVengeful Spiritallowing you to attack both of them. 
If they try to leap into the air an assurance of landing damage can be 
dealt with by usingAbyss ShriekorHowling Wraiths - just be mindful that if 
you plan on using your Spells more often to equipShaman StoneandSpell 
Twisterto increase the effectiveness of your spells.At some point, there 
will be moment s in the battle where you get cornered and the only way to 
dodge is to dash. If you have theShade CloakorMothwing Cloakability, be 
sure to haveSharp Shadowequipped so that you can deal damage and evade at 
the same time.The next Challenge gate will be direc tly next to the 
Pantheon of the Master.Pantheon of the ArtistSeek the God Inspired.Below 
are the Enemies players should expect to encounter during this Pantheon 
before finally face the final boss of this Pantheon, Paintmaster Sheo. 
After each Pantheon tria l before the final boss, the Godseeker will 
speakappear with a dialogue sequence. Ahh! Will the Gods not relieve Us 
of this troublesome speck? How it tests Us, seeing this worm raise its 
filthy weapon to the Gods! Thou hast luck beyond luck, o speck! The G ods 
of this pantheon, for purpose beyond Our understanding, allow you amongst 
them. Truly, the divine punishment they must be planning for you will be

VesselPaintmaster SheoPaintmaster SheoPaintmaster Sheo is the final boss 
in thePantheon of the Artist. Sheo's attacks can be evaded easily since 
similar to his fellow Nailmasters, Sheo needs to charge before releasing 
an attack a nd has a bit of a slow animation which allows players to 
predict its movements. An attack that is recommended to watch out for 
isGreat Slashand the Lunge Attack since both have quite a long range that 
is enough to reach The Knight.Sheo can be staggered whi ch you can use to 
either heal or go on the offense and bombard him with attacks. Your 
spells can be handy in this battle since you will be dancing around the 
arena to try and evade Sheo's long -range attacks, spells such asShade Soul,Abyss Shriek, andDescen ding Darkwill allow you to deal damage in all 
ranges and direction Sheo tries to move around - just be sure to 
haveShaman StoneandSpell Twisterto increase the overall effectiveness of 
your spells,Soul Eateris also best paired with to increase the number of  
SOULS replenished from landing basic attacks.Clearing this battle will 
reveal your trial time. Clearing this Pantheon will unlock 
theAchievement: Inspiration.Pantheon of the SageYou will need to have 
fought all the required bosses for the third door shown  on symbols upon 
inspecting it. Below are the enemies you will face before encountering 
this Pantheon's final boss,Great Nailsage Sly.After each Pantheon trial 
before the final boss, the Godseeker will speak appear with a dialogue 
sequence. Thou art painfu lly persistent! Why dost thou defile this 
pantheon with thine presence? Seek ye glory, o vain one? Thou 
misunderstand Our purpose. Through ritual combat are We attuned to the 
voices of the Gods. Ever higher do they lead Us! Higher and higher and 
higher! Un til through Godly focus do We attain communion with that great 
power sleeping in the Kingdom s heart XeroCrystal GuardianSoul

SlyThe Great Nailsage Sly is quite a difficult and tricky  boss. Compared 
to the others, he is faster and has a shorter recovery rate of executing 
one attack after the other. Sly can be fought inGodhomeand appear as the 
final boss in thePantheon of the Sage. It is recommended that you rely on 
your Spells or Charm s that provide long -range effects or buffs. So first, 
let's talk about the Charms.Quick Focusis a must to have equipped since 
Sly will not stop and will only give you little time or an opportunity to 
recover your health. So having this charm can help you r ecover health at 
a faster rate. Maintaining a safe space between you and Sly will be 
important, so in conjunction with that, make sure to haveMark of Prideto 
increase the range of the Nail allowing you to strike and be safe from a 
distance.Quick Slashis al so helpful so that you can strike at even a 
faster rate.Spells,Shade SoulorVengeful Spiritwill most likely work 
here,Abyss ShriekorDescending Darkisn't recommended since Sly constantly 
dances around the arena and you'll most likely miss. The reason why Sha de 
Soul or Vengeful Spirit can work since it can be executed fast and can 
guarantee that it will hit Sly. But of course, if you plan on using your 
spells more often than The Nail, you must have the following charms 
equipped that can buff the overall effect iveness of your Spells -Shaman 
Stoneto increase the effect of the spells,Spell Twisterto reduce the SOUL 
required whenever you cast a spell, andSoul CatcherorSoul Eaterto 
increase the amount of SOUL gained from striking the enemy with The 
Nail.Keep your di stance at all times, use long -range attacks, take your 
time, and use the opportunity to strike Sly whenever he falls onto the 
ground after performing an aerial attack.Clearing this battle will reveal 
your trial time. Clearing this Pantheon will unlock theA chievement:

 Path of Pain Main LocationWhite PalacePath of Painis a Sub -Area 
Locationin Hollow Knight. Path of Pain can be found within White Palace. 
The various locations and sub -areas of the forgotten kingdo m of 
Hallownest feature a variety of objectives, quests, and secrets that need 
to be uncovered, as well as NPCsand hostile characters that are 
encountered through your journey.Path of Pain InformationPath of Pain can 
be found within White Palace.Path of Pa in can be opened by destroying a 
breakable wall just above the elevator in the upper part of the 
map.Completing this area will unlock a cutscene where you will see a 
depiction of the Pale King and a younger version of the Hollow Knight, 
alongside a Journal  Entry for the Seal of Binding.The area is made up of 
several sections. Platforming the area can be difficult as it requires 
precise movement and good timing of jumps.You will need to use a 
technique known as pogoing to beat this area. Jump and hit the haz ards 
underneath you with the Nail to generate knockback. Pogoing can halt your 
movement when there's no place to rest, or let you traverse a dangerous 
spot on the back of a moving hazard. It may take some practice to get the 
pogo timing right.Pogoing is ma de easier with charms like Longnail or 
Mark of Pride. Hiveblood and/or Grubsong can be useful for regaining 
health, so that you're not sent to the bench every five minutes.The thorns that cover the walls in the Path of Pain cannot be pogoed. You'll 
have to use the buzzsaws and spikes to control your movement.Similar to 
other platforming areas, the saws and spikes in the Path of Pain follow a 
single rhythm. Watch the hazards and count as they appear and vanish. It 
might even help to tap your foot or nod. Aft er a while you'll know which 
beats are safe, when to jump or hit the attack button.After you've 
managed to reach the final section, you'll fall down into a pit where 
you'll see yourself surrounded by thorns on the wall. You'll have to 
defeat the two Kingsm oulds in the area to end the challenge. Spells are 
very effective in dealing with them quickly.After completing this 
challenge, you'll wake up outside the area, and the Path of Pain will 
become inaccessible and you can no longer enter the sub -area again.It ems

TipsA Pilflip can be found patrolling an area and will become hostile 
upon hitting it.Pilflips are unique - upon striking it, it will flip onto 
its back and will chase The Knight by hopping which deals damage upon 
contact. Once you strike it again, it will flip back to its original form 
and return back to patrolling its area.The name "Pilflip" is a joke, as 
it accounts for their flipping, but it also can  be flipped around to 
spell the same thing. This phenomenon is known as a 
palindrome.EnemiesAluba,Ambloom,Armoured Squit,Aspid Hatchling,Aspid Hunter,Aspid Mother,Baldur,Battle Obble,Belfly,Bluggsac,Boofly,Carver

Gardens WalkthroughInto the Queen's GardensTo get to the Queen's Gardens, 
head to the western part of the map and enter  the area via the Fog 
Canyon. Upon arriving, head west towards the Mosscreep and Spiny Husk 
enemies, drop to the bottom, then east where you'll find yourself trapped 
inside a mini -arena. You'll have to clear out two waves of Mantis 
Petrafor the gates to re -open then continue heading northeast into the 
next section where Corniferis.As soon as you enter, you'll hear 
Cornifer's voice. You'll have to work your way around to reach him, so 
continue heading west, then work your way around to reach him. Speak to 
him to purchase a copy of the map for 150 Geo - continue going left where 
you'll also find a bench that you can use.Acquire the Love KeyWhen you're 
done, head back outside and then drop down to where the pits with thorns 
are. You'll need to unlock the gate t hat is on your right to reach the 
area where the Love Key is, so for now, head left through the path with 
thorns where you'll find the lever that will unlock the gate at the 
bottom. Be careful when you're platforming since there is a Fool 
Eaterthat is burr owed into the ground and walls that will attack you once 
you are standing on top of it. Upon reaching the lever, flip it, then 
continue going east to make it around back to the locked gate - you can 
now enter the path which leads to the Love Key.Once you'r e in, simply 
head east then down southeast until you enter a room that has 
Mossfliesflying around. From here you'll want to jump to your right where you'll find a small cluster of Geo and a narrow path that has acid water 
in it. Collect the geo and swim th rough the acid water where you'll 
encounter 2x Mantis Traitorguarding the area, you'll have to kill both of 
the enemies to unlock the gate behind them where you'll be able to 
acquire the Love Keythat is lying next to a big corpse of a bug - upon 
acquiring the key, another Mantis Traitorwill appear.When you're done, 
head back to the previous section then look to the lower left to find a 
Whispering Root tree. Strike it with the Dream Nail for the Essence to 
burst out, collect it and try to follow it until you  reach the 
southwestern part of the room, enter the opening to your left to reach 
the next section.The Second BenchYou should now find yourself in a 
section with multiple metal platforms, a spiked pit at the bottom, 
andMossfliesalongside Mantis Petrasflyin g around. Head west until you 
reach the entrance of the next section, just be careful when platforming 
since the metal platforms will flip down after a second once you jump on 
it and the flying mantis will constantly attack you while you try to 
cross. Cont inue heading west until you reach a toll machinethat requires 
150 Geo to unlock the bench - when you're done head back to the previous 
section where the bench sign is.*** The path that you can drop down into 
near the bench can take you back to Deepnest.The  Path to MarmuOnce you've 
returned back to the section where the bench sign is, climb up the wall 
to enter the next section. You'll notice at the top right that there is a 
sign of a stag station that is pointing east. Follow it and you'll be 
locked inside a mini-arena where you'll have to fightthree waves of 
enemies including a Mantis Petra, Mantis Traitor, and Spiny Husk. After 
clearing the last wave, the gates will re -open.Continue head east, the go 
up towards theMossfliesare, then west through another pa th that is filled 
with thorns. Now, before heading up into the next section, continue going 
to your left to find a small cluster of geo and a secret room at the end 
where you can find a trapped Grub. Free it then continue into the next 
section that is abov e - once you arrive, you'll notice that the door to 
your left which leads into the Stag Station is locked, so you'll need to 
make your way around by going up then left into the next section followed 
by going southeast until you reach a monument of a warrio r dream called 
Marmu.Boss Battle, MarmuWhen you walk up to the monument, Marmu's spirit 
will appear above. At this point, you'll want to fight any dream warrior 
you can encounter in order to gain Essence and to obtain the Awoken Dream 
Nail. Speak to Marmu and challenge him to start the battle. Fighting him 
is easy since he only has one attack in which he curls up into a ball and 
charges in try to get close to you. It is recommended to have the Mark of 
Pridecharm equipped to increase therange of The Nail all owing you to land 
your hits from further away. By doing so, it will also knock him back 
each time he gets hit. You can click hereto learn more about the 
strategies on how to defeat Marmu.Once you've defeated this warrior 
spirit, speak to him again to acqui re 150 Essence. Now, continue heading 
east at the top to find a secret entrance that will take you to the Stag 
Station. Approach the toll machine and pay 200 Geo to unlock it then rest 
at the bench next to it to save your game and prepare for the main boss  
of this location - also, don't forget to flip the switch to your right to 
unlock a shortcut.The Path to the Traitor LordFrom the Stag Station, head 
east, then climb all the way to the top and then head east again into the 
next section where you'll find a lever that removes a blockage that's on 
the ground next to it. Continue heading east from the lever, then climb 
up again, then west into a section where you'll need to do a lot of platforming again to get across and to avoid getting hit by the 
thorns.Once you're through, you'll come across an entrance to your left 
which will lead you to where the Traitor Lord is. However, before doing 
so, you can take a detour, andheadup to where the Spiny Huskand Mantis 
Petrais until you reach the gazebo -like structure whi ch is at the top. 
When you reach it, you can break the glass on your left to open up the 
path which leads to another Grub. You'll have to cling onto the walls to 
climb and use the Crystal Heartability to get across one end to the 
other. Just be careful sin ce there is a Mossflyflying around the path. 
After rescuing the Grub, head back to the previous section and then head 
left to where the Traitor Lord is.You should find yourself inside a 
section where a stream of void is blocking your path. But with the Sha de 
Cloakability that you've gained earlier, you can easily phase through the 
stream and continue through the spiked path until you reach the arena of 
the Traitor Lord. Upon arriving, the gates will close and you'll have to 
fight and kill two waves of Manti s Traitorsbefore the Traitor 
Lordappears.Boss Battle, Traitor LordThe battle with the Traitor Lordwill 
start once he appears after killing two waves of theMantis Traitors. This 
battle will be quite difficult and challenging since he has been buffed 
in an update that was previously released which gives him 800 HP, two 
melee attacks and 2 ranged attacks. You can click hereto learn more about 
the strategies on how to defeat this boss. Upon defeating the Traitor 
Lord, the gates will re -open and you'll be able t o gain access to The 
White Lady's chamber.The White LadyFrom the arena of the Traitor Lord, 
head west where you'll find the chamber of The White Lady. Head inside 
and go through the path where you'll find The White Ladyherself, aroot -
like non -insect being,  who is wrapped in a shell -like cocoon that 
resembles tree bark. Speak to her and she will provide The Knight half of 
the Kingsoulcharm. This marks the completion of this location, up next is 
Fog Canyon.*** You can also head back to theeastern side of theC ity of

 Quirrel   LocationBlack Egg Temple, Greenpath, Queen s Station, Ma ntis 
Village, City of Tears, Deepnest, Crystal Peak, Teacher s Archives, Blue 
LakeQuirrel is one of the first NPCs you will meet in the kingdom of 
Hallownest. First found in the Black Egg Temple, you can find him in 
various other places around the map.He i s a pill -bug who is known as an 
explorer, as well as a very intelligent scholar who knows much about 
Hallownest. Quirrel is also extremely skilled at wielding a nail. He acts 
as a kindhearted and optimistic guide to the Knight, appearing in various 
locations throughout the Kingdom.Quirrel InformationJust like the Knight, 
Quirrel is an amnesiac and doesn't remember Hallownest, or his unknown 
association with Monomon the Dreamer, despite being a part of itin the 
past. His past is shrouded in mystery that is n ot made clear in the game. 
Quirrel is very enigmatic, though incredibly kindhearted, optimistic,and 
helpful to those he meets, including the Knight, who he guides. He has a 
calm and peaceful disposition, and although he wields a sharp nail and is 
an extrem ely skilled warrior and nail -wielder, he is pacifistic and only 
ever fights to protect himself and others (such as the Knight when he 
assists him). Quirrel wears Monomon's mask on his head for the majority 
of the game, but takes it off to undo the Teacher s seal after helping 
the Knight defeat Uumuu. Shortly after this event, Quirrel remembers 
small parts of his past. Though he is still amnesic about his past and 
his association with the kingdom of Hallownest, he remains very much at 
peace, and very optimis tic about his adventures, and admits that he is 
happy and astonished to witness the Knight s prowess and to journey 
through Hallownest yet again. He mysteriously vanishes from Hallownest 
after his final appearance at the Blue Lake where all that remains is  his 
nail.Location: Quirrel can initially be found at the Black Egg 
Temple.Progression: Quirrel moves to Greenpath (The Lake of Unn), 
Queens Station, the Mantis Village, the City of Tears, Deepnest (hot -
spring), Crystal Peak, then to the Teacher's Archive s in Fog Canyon, and 
finally at the Blue Lake.Combat: Players may not kill Quirrel.Rewards: 
Quirrel does not give the player any rewards, but assists in the battle 
withUumuu.Dialogue"Hello there! How delightful to meet another traveller 
on these forgotten roads. You're a short one, but you have a strong look 
about you. I'm Quirrel. I have something of an obsession with uncharted 
places.""Plenty have come before us and met their grisly end, many more 
equipped than you and I. I'm sure they wouldn't mind were a fellow 
explorer to relieve them of their tools. It's a kindness really. the dead 
shouldn't be burdened with such things.""Has she called you here, 
too?"Notes & TipsSitting beside Quirrel in silence after the player's 
final interaction with him grants you  the "Witness" achievement, due to 
Quirrel being a major witness to the Knight s prowess. If you leave the 
room, Quirrel will disappear and his nail will be left behind.When 
fighting Uumuu in the Teacher's Archives, this bosswill only be vulnerable when Qu irrel lets out a yell and attacks it with his 
nail.NPCsBardoon,Bretta,Brumm,Charm Lover Salubra,Cloth,Confessor

Waterways WalkthroughGetting into the Royal WaterwaysTo get into t he 
Royal Waterways, head to the west side (on your left) of the City of 
Tearsfrom the Memorialof the Hollow Knight. You'll need a Simple Keyto 
unlock thehatch that leads into the waterways. You can find a Simple 
Keynear the Stag Station in the west side of  the City of Tears or by 
visiting Sly's shop in Dirtmouthandpurchasing it for 950 Geo. Take note 
that you'll be needing the Lumafly Lanternto further explore the area, 
which can also be bought from Sly for 1800 Geo.You will also need the 
Desolate Dive spel l for breaking floors, so be sure to visit Soul Master 
if you haven't done so already.Find a Bench and CorniferUpon arriving at 
the Royal Waterways, head west towards the path where you'll encounter a 
new enemy, 2x Pilflip. Fight your way through and conti nue west and into 
the next section - you should notice a sign of a bench that is on your 
right before entering the next section. From here, drop down and use 
Desolate Diveto break the floor, which will take you all the way down to 
a bench. Use it to save y our game and update your map.From here you'll 
want to walk to the right side of the bench to break the wall and open up 
a shortcut. When you're done, head back up until you reach the Bench sign 
again. Head across to the left where you'll encounter a Belfly . At the 
edge, drop down into the water and swim to the wall to your right. You 
can break the wall to discover a secret room that has a Grub that you can 
rescue.After rescuing the Grub, climb back up then continue going west by using the platforms and avoi ding the new enemies floating called a 
Hwurmp. Be cautious when avoiding it and try not to attack it since it 
will inflate like a blowfish once it is attacked and hits onto a surface 
or another enemy making them dangerous and difficult to avoid when 
there's multiple of them floating around - you'll notice that there will 
be a trail of paper on the ground, follow it into the next section where 
you'll encounter yet another new enemy called a Flukemon. Be careful when 
dealing with this enemy, since upon killin g it, it will cut into half 
where the top part will attack you and upon killing it, the other half 
will also jump in for an attack.Upon entering the next section, you'll 
still need to follow the trail of paper which will take you into the next 
room which i s to your left. You can find a Soul Totem to regain SOUL 
which is at the top left -hand side of the room just before entering the 
next section.Once you've reached the room at the far left, you'll hear 
Cornifer humming. As you continue forward, the gates wil l close and 
you'll need to kill all the Hwurmpfloating around for the gates to re -
open. When the gates are open, climb up to the middle platform, flip the 
switch above you to unlock the door at the bottom left that opens up the 
path that leads back to the Fungal Wastes, then continue going up to find 
Cornifer - you can purchase a copy of the map for 75 Geo.Acquire a Mask 
ShardFrom Cornifer's location, you'll want to walk to your right until 
you come across a floor that will break that takes you back into the

head towards a path leading to the first boss that you'll encounter in 
this area.Finding the FlukemarmFrom the bench, drop down into the opening

killing the en emies, walk onto the floor just near where you fell through 
to find a breakable floor, use Desolate Diveto open up a path to another 
area below. Upon arriving, you'll want to drop down one level, head left 
into the water, then right into a pit with more Fl ukefey and 
Flukemonenemies.Continue going east until you encounter a Belflyalongside 
the Flukefey and Flukemon enemies, from here, you'll want to drop down 
into the bottom part of the room then go west towards a narrow path that 
has some worms sticking out  of the floor and ceiling. You'll want to 
follow the path until you reach a high wall which can be destroyed to 
open up a secret passage that leads into the lair of the Flukemarm - 
before entering, you can replenish your SOUL by hitting the small worms 
with The Nail.Boss Battle, FlukemarmUpon arriving, you'll notice the 
Flukemarmhanging in the middle of the arena filled with elevated 
platforms. To start the battle, you'll have to attack it with The Nail or 
a spell. The Flukemarmonly has one attack which is s hooting out multiple

Waterways which is the next location called Isma's Grove - retrace your 
steps back to the tilted bench and save the game.Finding t he Dung 
DefenderTo find the Dung Defender, you'll have to head at the far east 
side of the roomwherethe tilted bench is. From the bench, you'll want to 
drop down into the path to your left then go east while fighting your way through the Flukefey and Fluke mon enemies. Eventually, you'll come across 
a small pit with water where you'll swim into to get across and then a 
path that is filled with dung - you'll know when he's close byonce you 
hear him shouting. Just follow the path and his voice until you reach his 
arena, the gates will close once you're inside then the ground will start 
to shake and the Dung Defenderwill appear which prompts the start of the 
battle.Boss Battle, Dung DefenderA couple of notes to remind you of, 
first, the Dung Defender's health ra nges from 700 - 900 HP depending on 
the type of Nail you have upgraded it into. Second, he has three attacks 
and one defensive tactic, and finally, he has two phases where he enters 
into a state of frenzy in phase two. You can click hereto learn more 
about the strategies on how to defeat this boss - upon defeating the Dung 
Defender, he drops the Defender's Crestcharm as a reward and also grants 
you access to the switch that unlocks the path to Isma's Grove.From the 
Dung Defender's arena, head into the room to your right to find a huge 
lever. Flip it to drain the acid water from the entrance of Isma's Grove 
which will now allow you to reach that area. There is also a breakable 
wall to your right that opens up a path that will take you to a busted 
lift that co nnects between the City of Tearsand the Ancient Basin. For

LocationsPlayers can unlock any Stag Station found within the map. But 
the easiest way to locate one isin the Forgotten Crossroadsor 
Dirtmouth.Secret of the Stagways WalkthroughThe stagway consists of a 
path of tunnels that connects various ports within the kingdom of 
Hallownest, and these ports are called Stag Stations. Upon encountering 
your first Stag Station, players must hit the bell with The Nail to 
summon The La st Stag- he will mention to The Knight that it has been 
quite a very long period of time since someone has summoned him for 
traveling, this will also unlock the quest of unlocking all Stag Stations 
and finding his birthplace.There is a total of11 Stag Stat ions (Stag Nest 
being the last and a hidden station) that can be found where you will 
need to pay Geo at a toll machine to unlock it, similar to your first 
encounter with The Last Stag, immediately strike the bell with The Nail 
after paying geo at a Stag S tation's toll machine to summon The Last 
Stag. In addition, he will also share facts about the area of each 
station that has been unlocked and he willbegin to remember the 
whereabouts of the Stag Nest. Listed below are the Stag Stations' 
locations and pric es.There is one station that is a hidden room that can 
be found in the Palace Grounds, you can find it behind a wall that can be 
destroyed - its location is indicated above.Afterall of the Stag Stations 
have been unlocked, The Last Stag will be able to rec all the location of 
the Stag Nest, allowing him to bring The Knight there. Once you are in the Stag Nest head to the east of the path where you will come across 
corpses of Stags, a Vessel Fragment and at the end, a lift, hop on it to 
reach the 2nd level.No w head to the western end of the area where you 
will find unhatched Stag Eggs along with one broken egg. Head back down 
and speak to The Last Stag where you will notice his name will change 
into Old Stag, this implies that there is still hope that his kind  has 
survived the catastrophe and has ventured beyond the walls of 
Hallownest.This completes the quest and unlocks the Connection and Hope

The Seer is a moth and is the last surviving species of the moths and the 
moth tribe.The Seer InformationThe Seeris a merchant in the game that 
provides items and unlocks an achievement in exchange for collecting and 
giving Essence. She is the one wh o provides the Dream Nailthat allows the 
Knight to look into the dreams of the NPCs. She is also the one rescues 
The Knight by guiding them through the realm of the Dreamers.She is the 
last member of the Moth Tribe, a nation that studied dreams and 
worshipped the dream deity, The Radiance. After joining Hallownest, the 
Moths continued to guard dream spirits, but a large portion of their 
culture has been forgotten over the years, particularly the worshiping 
practices. The Seer regards her tribe's betrayal of  The Radiance as a 
source of guilt.After the Knight has gathered 2400 Essence, the Sheer 
will ascend. While it is unclear what the process of her ascension 
entails, it seems that she lets go of her guilt. It is possible that she 
is redeemed in The Radiance 's eyes and allowed to join its dream 
realm.Location: The Seer Can be found at the Resting GroundsCombat:

The Knight's total health and Type of  Nail.DropsAll Geo lost upon 
death.Shade is an enemy in Hollow Knight.The enemies are creaturesthat 
have succumbed into The Infection and has turned them into hostilebeings 
who are determined to kill anyone who crosses their path. Acquiring the 
Hunter's Jo urnalallows The Knight to acquire additional notes on an 
encountered and defeated enemy such as bits and pieces of lore, 
information on how to deal with the enemy, and information on The 
Hunter.Echo of a previous life. Defeat it to retake its power and bec ome 
whole.Each of us leaves an imprint of something when we die. A stain on 
the world. I don't know how much longer this kingdom can bear the weight 
of so many past lives...Shade LocationRecent death location of The 
Knight.Summoned by Confessor Jijiin Dirt mouth.Shade RewardsRecover all 
lost Geo upon death.Replenish The Knight's SOUL Meter to normal.Shade 
Notes & TipsUpon dying, the Shade will appear at the area where The 
Knight recently died or the area/room before the death location.Upon 
killing the Shade,  The Knight recovers all lost Geo along with the SOUL 
Meter returning to normal. In the event that The Knight dies again before 
finding The Shade, a new Shade will appear at thenew location and the old 
Shade will disappear along with whichever amount of Ge o it had. The new 
Shade, however, will now carry whichever new amount of Geo it will hold 
onto that The Knight has collected before dying the 2nd time around.To 
find out if you are approaching The Shade, an eerie melody will start to 
play which notifies th e player that The Shade is around. Once you engage 
in battle, The Shade will also strike by using The Nail and will conjure 
whatever Spells The Knight has learned.The Shade's health depends on the 
Type of Nail that The Knight has along with the number of H ealth Masks 
The Knight has:   For example, if The Knight has a Coiled Nail that has 
17 Damage and has 9 Health Masks, The Shade's health will be 68. Where if 
The Knight has a Pure Nail that has 21 Damage and has 8 Health Masks, The 
Shades health will resul t in 84 HP.The health of The Shade is calculated 
by the Nail damage multiplied by half of the number of Health Masks that 
The Knight has. Striking The Shade with a Dream Nailwill instantly kill 
it regardless of whichever amount of HP it has.If you are havi ng trouble 
finding The Shade or have forgotten its location, you can simply talk to

Gates scattered through Hallownest.Shade Cloak has a short cooldown of 
~1.5 seconds. This cooldown is independent of the standard Dash 
ability.WhileShade Cloak is on cooldown, The Knight can still perform a 
regular dash, but it will not have the invincibility frames granted by 
the ability.Shade Cloak's cooldown is indicated by shadowy particles 
floating around the Knight. Once these particles are reabsorbed by the 
Knight, theShadow Dash is ready for  use once again.Shadow Dash will 
destroy most projectiles, but will not protect the Knight against 
environmental hazards.How toObtain Shade Cloak in Hollow KnightTheShade

Reduces theSOULcost to 24 per cast.Flukenest - ReplacesShade Soulwith a 
short range shotgun -like burst of 16baby flukes. Each fluke deals 4

 Snail Shaman   LocationAncestral MoundSnail Shaman is an NPCin Hollow 
Knight. Snail Shaman i s a knowledgeable being who creates and knows 
various spells and is assumed to be the last surviving member of the clan 
of the Snail Shamans.Snail Shaman InformationThe Snail Shaman is somehow 
the last surviving being of her kind. She can be found at the A ncestral 
Mound where she provides the Vengeful Spirit spell and leaves The Knight 
with a task to kill an Elder Baldur. As you explore Hallownest, other 
snail shamans can be found dead in various places: one at the 
Crystallised Mound, one at the Overgrown M ound, one at the Soul Sanctum, 
and one (or at least one's sarcophagus) at the Resting Grounds.Speaking 
to the Snail Shaman after acquiring new spells will trigger unique 
dialogue, providing more information about the spells as well as the 
shamans who once wielded them. Based on her stories, all these shamans 
were her relatives (she refers to most of them as female). She also sadly 
mentions that she is bound at the Ancestral Mound, which prevents her 
from visiting her family. It is unknown if this means she is simply not 
allowed to leave the Ancestral Mound, or if she physically 
cannot.Location: Snail Shaman Can be found at the Ancestral Mound.Combat: 
Players may not kill Snail Shaman.Rewards:Speaking to her upon the first 
encounter will reward you with the V engeful Spirit spell.Associated

Vessels throughout t he game, and these can be crafted by collecting

with 6 SOUL per hit.Equipping the Soul Catcher will increase this to 8

Master is a Boss in Hollow Knight. Bosses are special Enemiesth at feature 
their own arena, a large amount of health, and a variety of unique moves 
and abilities.You will need to perform multiple attacks such as using The 
Nail and Nail Arts along with theSpells and Abilitiesin order to defeat 
them. Some bosses are capa ble of entering into a state of stagger after 
landing a number of attacks on them.As soon as you encounter a boss,its 
name will appear on the screen, the music will change into a boss battle 
theme, and usually, pathsconnecting the arena will close or will be 
blocked leaving you no choice but to face these devastating and unique 
foes.Head of the Soul Sanctum. Hoarded soul hoping to stave off 
Hallownest's affliction, but eventually became intoxicated by its 
power.The bugs of Hallownest tried all kinds of tric ks and rituals and 
prayers to rid themselves of the infection. But to no avail! Perhaps the 
infection came from somewhere deep inside of them that they could not escape. Soul Master LocationSoul SanctumSoul Master Rewards380Desolate 
DiveSoul Master Strateg iesStrategy WriteupSoul Master is yet another 
unpredictable boss and a trickster, most of his attacks allow him to 
quickly shift into another attack or even fakes his movements before even 
executing an attack. Depending on how you progress in the game, hav ing 
certain Spells and Abilitiesare recommended for you to win this fight, 
having the Mothwing Cloakability will be handy here as you will need to 
frequently dodge around the arena. Howling Wraithscan also be useful 
since Soul Master will sometimes appear above you, allowing for a spell 
attack.Now, your movement and the ability to time your attacks is very 
important in this battle. Most of his attacks can be dodged, and jumping 
or dashing will be your best friend in evading his attacks. Whenever Soul 
Master tries to use his rotating orbs, be sure to only perform a short 
jump and focus on the orb that is most likely to hit you. If he instead 
summons the orbs that target you, it is best to watch out for the 
direction and time your jumps right.Soul Master has 2  phases, upon 
defeating him the first time, the Desolate Dive spell will appear and 
after you try to acquire it, Soul Master will reappear and slam down onto 
the glass ground where you will find yourself in a new arena for phase 2. 
Soul Master in the secon d phase will only have two attacks: an enhanced 
slam and orb attack. It is recommended that you focus on dodging when 
Soul Master uses his slam attack. He will always spawn directly above 
you, so just stay on the move. Since the slam has a wind -up and he c an 
fake out his attack, you can interrupt or land one or two hits before 
committing to dodging his actual attacks.Once he shifts into his 2nd 
attack, which is summoning orbs, use this opportunity to land multiple 
attacks since he will be telegraphing this attack in place.Take your time 
and strike when the opportunity is available.Attacks & 
CountersAttackCounterPhase 1Dash AttackSoul Master teleports to either 
the left or right side of the arena and dashes towards The Knight until 
it hits a wall. It's best t o run away from the Soul Master and jump at 
the right time, followed by executing a downward attack to deal 
damage.Soul SlamA fast attack where Soul Master will teleport up high and 
quickly slam onto the ground where The Knight is standing followed by 
emitting a shockwave. Watch if the Soul Master will teleport even higher 
and maintain a distance and be ready to jump after it slams on the ground 
since the shockwaves will follow.Fake OutIn conjunction with the Soul 
Slam, Soul Master can fake out its slam att ack once before actually 
slamming onto the ground. This is quite tricky since Soul Master 
telegraphs it quickly, so the recommended strategy is to take your time 
and try to dash to maintain a distance enough for you to avoid both the 
slam attack and shockw aves released. Do not jump since you will take 
damage upon contact with Soul MasterOrb of InfectionA projectile attack 
where Soul Master will shoot one or two orbs that target and follows The 
Knight. It can be easily dodged, but you will need to bait it fo r it to 
hit a wall or the ground for it to completely disperse. If you dodge it 
but it doesn't hit any surface, it will continue to chase you like a 
boomerang.Rotating OrbsAn attack that works as an offensive and defensive 
tactic for Soul Master. Four rota ting orbs will appear around Soul Master 
where he will try to fly towards the direction of The Knight. Afterward, 
he will disappear for a short moment and the orbs will fly towards The 
Knight. Be mindful that not only does the orb deal damage upon contact,  
but also Soul Master himself if you get close enough while evading. It is 
recommended to jump at a normal height instead of trying to jump up high - focus on the orb that is at the same level of The Knight so that you 
can dodge it while Soul Boss flies in .Phase 2Final SlamSoul Master will 
change its slam attack into a stronger and trickier version. While he 
charges the attack, Soul Master will float and track The Knight's 
position and follow up with slamming onto the ground, he can also mix up 
with another  fake out before actually slamming onto the ground. Instead 
of releasing shockwaves, a huge burst of energy will be released that 
deals damage upon contact. Be aware that Soul Master can perform this 
attack multiple times before shifting into another attac k.Summoned 
OrbsSoul Master also changes his Orb attacks where he will conjure Orbs 
in random locations that will shoot towards The Knight. Soul Master 
conjures this attack in place, so you can have the assurance of landing 
multiple attacks, but be mindful of the orbs since it comes out in a 
random time and location.Soul Master LoreSoul Master is the leader of the 
Soul Sanctum of Hallownest who once worked hand -in-hand with The Pale 
King. He was committed to finding solutions and ways to expand the mind 
and soul of the bugs to acquire pure focus. During the spread of The 
Infection, he opposed The Pale King's plan and instead came up with the 
solution of using SOUL as a cure. It seems that his efforts were in vain, 
as he is overtaken by The Infection when the Knight meets him.He and his 
followers continue to use and consume SOUL even as infected husks of 
their former selves. It is hinted that their use of SOUL and lust for 
power had corrupted them before The Infection did.The dialogue with the 
Soul Master's dre am variant, Soul Tyrant, reveals that he was obsessed 
with immortality, driving him to perform progressively more extreme 
experiments on other bugs and himself. Using Dream Nail on him will also 
produce a dialogue line that suggests a link between the SOUL  use and the 
onset of The Infection (he wonders if "their souls brought him closer to 
light"). The harmful effect of SOUL is further supported by the Follies 
that inhabit the Soul Sanctum: they are described as bugs who misused 
SOUL, presumably by consumin g too much of it.While exploring the Soul 
Sanctum, players can encounter a corpse of a Snail Shaman hooked up to a 
device of unknown purpose. Talking to the survivingSnail Shaman after 
acquiring theDesolate Dive spell will reveal that this spell used to 
belong to the Snail Shaman clan, implying that the Soul Master stole it 
and that the Shaman was killed in the process.Soul Master Notes & 
TriviaDefeating the Soul Master unlocks the "Illumination" 
Trophy/AchievementSoul Master is the only boss that grants Th e Knight 
with a Spell as a reward. This Spell is Desolate Dive, and you can 
actually see him using it in the fight. Desolate Dive is the only spell 
that you can get that does not involve Snail Shamans or the Abyss. 
Presumably, he stole Desolate Dive from t he Snail Shaman in the Soul 
Sanctum.BossesBroken Vessel,Brooding Mawlek,Brothers Oro and Mato,Crystal

done, head back down and ride the lift all the way up that will take you 
to a boss arena.Boss Battle, Soul WarriorUpon entering the ar ena, the 
doors will close and the Soul Warrior will appear. The Soul Warrior has 
three attacks, first is a lunge attack, the second is an overhead attack, 
and the third is a projectile attack. This boss is able to mix -up its 
attacks but each time it telegr aphs its attacks it'll take about half a 
second before it actually executes its attack. For example, you'll know 
if it will perform a lunge attack when it swings its weapon behind its 
back before striking. To learn more about the strategies on how to defea t 
this boss, you can click here - the Soul Warrior drops Geo upon 
defeat.Further into the SanctumAfter the boss battle, go right into the 
next section, jump down into the opening, and head all the way to the 
bottom to find another section you can head into to unlock a shortcut.

filled with SOUL. Once you're done, make your way to the top towards 
northeast where you'll find another switch, hit it to unlock the door 
below you then ride the li ftup - continue going up and into the next 
section while fighting your way through 3x Mistake.From here, you'll 
notice the door to your left is locked so you'll need to work your way 
around by jumping down to the bottom then climb back up to get to the 
other side. Just be careful since you'll be fighting about 3x Soul 
Twisteras you try to reach make it around.Once you've reached the 
northwestern side, you can flip the switch first that's on your right to 
unlock the door. Now, head left, climb up to where yo u'll see a 
Mistakeand go right until you reach the end. Here, you'll be able to find 
the Spell Twister charm. Just be careful since there will be multiple 
Follyand Mistakeenemies that will spawn around the area - after acquiring

lead you into another boss arena.Boss Battle, Soul MasterUpon entering 
the room, drop down the path where you'll find 3 jars of SOUL. Break the jars to acquire the SOUL if needed. Continue going left until you rea ch 
the arena of the boss, Soul Master. Stand in the middle and look at the 
background as the boss floats from behind, the battle begins once it 
teleports onto your position.The Soul Masteris a trickster; he fakes out 
his movements before he actually execut es his attack. It is best to watch 
out for his slam attack where he'll teleport above The Knight then dive 
onto the ground following up with a shockwave, the Soul Master can fake 
this attack by teleporting twice then actually diving on the ground after 
the 2nd blink. You can click hereto learn more about the strategies on 
how to defeat this boss. Another note to remember is that this boss has 
two phases, where at the first upon defeating him, he'll drop the 
Desolate Dive ability. Upon absorbing it, he'll re appear to grab the 
ability and then dive onto the ground causing the glass floor to break - 
you'll now find yourself facing the Soul Master in its second phase in 
the second arena.At this point, the Soul Masterwill change up his 
attacks, allowing him to be  more aggressive and dangerous. After you've 
finally defeated him, he'll drop the Desolate Dive ability that you can 
finally absorb. With this ability, you'll be able to break fragile floors 
and locate new areas. Now, you'll head off to the next location, the 
Crystal Peak.Video[video goes here]MapClick on the image to enlarge the

Tyrant LocationLocation: Soul SanctumSoul Tyrant RewardsRewards 300 
EssenceSoul Tyrant  StrategiesStrategy WriteupSoul Tyrant is the dream 
variant of Soul Master, it has the same moves with a few minor changes 
and it attacks at a much faster rate. The Soul Tyrant also teleports much 
more rapidly than the Soul Master and that s what makes it difficult to 
land an attack on him. It ll be difficult for you to gather Soul so it 
is advisable to have Charms like Soul Eater and Soul Catcher equipped. 
The Mothwing Cloak is an ability you must have as it will help you 
maneuver and dodge effectively aga inst its attacks. Howling Wraiths can 
also be useful for this fight as the Soul Tyrant often flies over 
you.Similar to its weaker counterpart, the Soul Tyrant also has 2 phases 
for the fight. It is important for you to time your jump, dodges, and 
movement when fighting this enemy. The most annoying move he has is its 
rotating orbs, try to perform only a short hop when you see it coming 
towards you, as it will most likely hit you on your level. When he 
summons those homing orbs, be sure to time your dodge co rrectly, try 
running to a wall first then jump, if you jump too early or dodge it 
without hitting the ground or wall, the orb will continue to chase you as 
it has strong homing.After defeating him, the Soul Tyrant will smash 
through the floor. There are en ough floors that remain before you can go 
down with the Soul Tyrant, so use this time to heal if you need to before 
coming down, as the 2nd phase will only trigger once you come down with 
the Soul Tyrant. During this phase, you won t have any time to heal,  as 
orbs will come at a non -stop pace. Soul Tyrant s health is already low 
during this phase so it is best to use high damaging Spells and Abilities 
like the Desolate Dive and Abyss Shriek on him, this way you can defeat 
him quickly before you take more da mage. The Soul Tyrant also won t be 
using its Fake Out Slam during this phase. Take your time in observing 
the movements and try to strike when you see an opening, most of his 
moves are very telegraphed, and since you ve already fought the Soul 
Master, you  should have an idea on how some of his moves work.Attacks & 
CountersAttackCounterPhase 1Dash AttackSoulTyrant teleports to either the 
left or right side of the arena andwill dash towardsyou until it hits a 
wall. It's best to run away from the SoulTyrant a nd jump at the right 
time, followed by executing a downward attack to deal damage.Soul SlamA 
fast attack where the SoulTyrant will teleport up high and quickly slam 
onto the ground whereyou're standing followed by emitting a shockwave. 
Watch if the SoulTyr ant will teleport even higher and maintain a distance 
and be ready to jump after it slams on the ground since the shockwaves 
will follow. This time the shockwaves produced from the slam will be much 
more taller and will travel at a faster pace.Fake OutIn c onjunction with 
the Soul Slam, SoulTyrant can fake out its slam attack once before 
actually slamming onto the ground. This is quite tricky since SoulTyrant 
telegraphs it quickly, so the recommended strategy is to take your time 
and try to dash to maintain a distance enough for you to avoid both the 
slam attack and shockwaves released. Do not jump since you will take 
damage upon contact with SoulTyrant.Orb of InfectionA projectile attack 
where SoulTyrant will shoot one or two orbs that will target and follow  
you. It can be easily dodged, but you will need to bait it for it to hit 
a wall or the ground for it to completely disperse. If you dodge it but 
it doesn't hit any surface, it will continue to chase you since this 
attack has strong homing.Rotating OrbsAn attack that works as an offensive and defensive tactic for Soul Tyrant. This time, six rotating 
orbs will appear around SoulTyrant where he will try to fly towards your 
direction. Afterward, he will disappear for a short moment and the orbs 
will fly toward s you. Be mindful that not only does the orb deal damage 
upon contact, but also SoulTyrant himself if you get close enough while 
evading. It is recommended to jump at a normal height instead of trying 
to jump up high - focus on the orb that iswithin the sa me level as you so 
that you can dodge it while the SoulTyrant flies in.Phase 2Final 
SlamSoulTyrant will change its slam attack into a stronger and trickier 
version. This time, the impact radius of each slam will be much larger 
compared to the Soul Master's  Final Slam. While he charges the attack, 
SoulTyrant will float and trackyour position and follow up with slamming 
onto the ground. Instead of releasing shockwaves, a huge burst of energy 
will be released that deals damage upon contact. Be aware that SoulT yrant 
can perform this attack multiple times before shifting into another 
attack.Summoned OrbsSoulTyrant also changes his Orb attacks where he will 
conjure Orbs in random locations that will shoot towards you. SoulTyrant 
conjures this attack in place, so y ou can have the assurance of landing 
multiple attacks, but be mindful of the orbs since it comes out in a 
random time and location.Soul Tyrant LoreThe Soul Tyrant is the Dream 
variation of theSoul Master. You can fight him by visiting the Soul 
Master's cor pse and striking it with the Dream Nail, where it'll 
transport you to the dream world. The Soul Tyrant has the same moves as 
the Soul Master, but it performs at a much faster pace with a few minor 
changes here and there.Soul Tyrant Notes & TriviaDefeating the Soul 
Tyrant unlocks the "Mortality" Achievement/Trophy.There is a bug in the 
2nd Phase of the fight where if you kill the Soul Tyrant as you take 
damage, the Soul Tyrant's death animation does not go through. This will 
mean that the Soul Tyrant is in i ts dying state but the infection does 
not burst out of him. If this happens, you are somehow stuck and the only 
way you can progress our get out is by exiting the game.BossesBroken

 Soul Vessel An additional storage for SOUL for The Knight. Soul Vesselis 
a Stat of The Knightin Hollow Knight.Soul Vessels are additional storage 
for SOUL. These are represented as small circles beside the main SOUL 
meter. If your main SOUL meter is full, the SOUL you will be gaining 
afterwards wil l then be transferred to one of your Soul Vessels if you've 
already crafted one.Soul Vessel UsageSoul Vessels transfer the SOUL into 
the main SOUL meter when it has free space or when SOUL is not being 
used. You will also notice that there's a delay when i t comes to the Soul 
Vessel transferring SOUL to the main meter once you've emptied it.How 
toAcquire Soul VesselBy collecting 3 Vessel Fragments, you'll be able to 
craft one Soul Vessel.You can acquire a total of 3 Soul Vessels 
throughout the game by collec ting Vessel Fragments.The Nail acquires SOUL 
for the Soul Vessel, providing 6 SOUL per hit.Equipping the Soul Catcher will increase this to 8 SOUL per hit.Equipping the Soul Eater will 
increase this to 12 SOUL per hit.The effects stack if both Soul Catcher  
and Soul Eater are equipped, granting you 14 SOUL per hit.Soul Vessel 
Notes & TipsA single Soul Vessel can contain about 33 SOUL.All other 
sources of SOUL fill up Soul Vessels at a normal rate.It is better for 
you to use SOUL as soon as possible when need ed if you have you Soul 
Vessels full because it takes more Nail hits to fill up your Soul Vessels 
than it is when transferring it to your main meter.   Hollow Knight The

that is encountered in the Soul Sanctumand in the Colosseum of Fools. 
Soul Warrior will teleport and dance around the arena with small windows 
to strike at it. It is best to punish once it executes a drop or after 
its dash attack. These attacks provide longer windows and are relatively 
easy to dodge. Be mindful of its projectile attack. During the figh the

kill the summoned enemies first then shift your focus back to the Soul 
Warrior.Attacks & CountersAttackCounterPhase 1Dive AttackSoul Warrior 
will teleport up into the air above The Knight and dive down for a slash

any AOE attack but instead only deals damage upon contact. Simply keep a 
distance from where it will land and jump in for the attack.Dash

spiritual energy that flows through most beings in Hallownest. SOUL can 
be harvested by The Knightby hitting Enemieswith the Nail. It is 
represented on the HUD by a large circular icon depicting a face, which 
fills up as more  SOUL is obtained. This main SOUL Meter can hold a 
maximum of 99 SOUL and eachSpell in Hollow Knight requires 33 SOUL to 
cast. Spell casting costs can be reduced to 24 SOUL by obtaining and 
equipping the Spell Twister Charm.SOUL is primarily obtained by at tacking 
Enemies, but can also be acquired from other sources such as Soul Totems, 
Hot Springs, as well as thepassive abilities granted by certain Charms. 
See the SOULpage for details on this resource.SOUL VesselsSOUL Vesselsare 
upgrades that The Knightcan acquire, granting them the ability tostore 
more SOULthan theSOUL Meter will allow.Soul Vessels are acquired by 
collecting Vessel Fragments. Every three fragments collected will 
permanently bestow upon The Knight an additional SOUL Vessel. Each Vessel 
can hold a maximum of 33 SOUL and they are filled when The Knight 
collects more of this resource while their mainSOUL Meter is full. SOUL 
contained in a vessel is automatically transferred to the main SOUL Meter

happens, and it will not occur while SOUL is being used such as while The 
Knight is healing or using other spells.The Knight can obtain a total of

heading east, you'll notice that the pool of void is filled with Void 
Tendrilsthat are stopping you to get across. From wher e you first 
encountered the Sibling, head up to the entrance of the Lighthouse by 
using the elevated platforms. Just be careful since there will be

MapThe Collector is a Boss in Hollow Knight. Bosses are special 
Enemiesthat feature their own arena, a large amount of health, and a 
variety of unique moves and abilities.You will need to perform multiple 
attacks such a s using The Nail and Nail Arts along with theSpells and 
Abilitiesin order to defeat them. Some bosses are capable of entering 
into a state of stagger after landing a number of attacks on them.As soon 
as you encounter a boss,its name will appear on the scre en, the music 
will change into a boss battle theme, and usually, pathsconnecting the 
arena will close or will be blocked leaving you no choice but to face 
these devastating and unique foes.Dark figure locked inside the Tower of 
Love. Preserves Hallownest's  creatures in glass jars with particular 
attention given to Grubs.A shadow that sometimes flits through the 
caverns, making strange noises to itself. I've never seen it clearly so I 
have no idea what type of creature it is.The Collector LocationTower of 
LoveGodhome(Mini -boss)The Collector Rewards3xGrubsThe Collector's MapThe 
Collector StrategiesStrategy WriteupThe Collector is an unpredictable and 
agile boss who loves to fake its attacks by continuously leaping around 
the arena and loves to keep you busy by  summoning enemies as well. The 
first thing you want to remember once you encounter The Collector is DO 
NOT JUMP. The Collector's attacks always start off with it leaping 
erratically which make you susceptible to getting hit if you try to evade 
by jumping.  Stay on the ground, keep a decent distance, be patient, and 
strike when the opportunity is available.Charms: Now, let's list down a 
couple of charms that can help you in battle. First, Thorns of Agony. 
This charm can be very useful as a counter attack sin ce it can quickly 
land a hit on The Collector regardless of its agility, the way the thorns 
emerge from The Knight is as fast as The Collector's speed and its radius 
will ensure that it will inflict damage on it. Grubsong, since you will 
receive damage mos t of the time, it is wise to have Grubsong equipped. 
This allows you to have another option of recovering SOUL while taking 
damage since striking The Collector with The Nail will not allow you to 
gain SOUL but only from the enemies summoned. Quick Focus, i t is an 
assurance that you will be healing a lot and Quick Focus is what you need 
in order to use your spells as fast as possible in order to keep up with 
the pace of The Collector. And finally,Quick Slash, it is highly 
recommended to have this equipped to  be able to perform your attacks 
faster allowing you to clean up the arena of the enemies as quickly as 
possible and securing at least one or two hits on The Collector - if you 
want to maximize your defensive capabilities, equipping Defender's Crest 
along withSpore Shroomis helpful since you can frequently inflict chip 
damage on the enemies and boss and you can release toxic gas and fill the room with it while using Focus to continuously inflict damage on the 
boss.Spells and Abilities: For the spells, it's more of a hit or miss 
situation since there's a small chance that you can inflict damage by 
using your spell due to The Collector's quick reflexes. It is recommended 
that you focus on upgrading the abilityMothwing Cloakto the Shade Cloakin 
order for you to  dash but also phase through its attacks.And finally, 
make sure you upgrade The Nailin order to maximize the damage of The 
Knight's primary weapon. You can check the Nailsmithpage to know more 
about upgrading The Nail.Attacks & CountersAttackCounterPhase 1 Rain of 
JarsThe Collector's main attack is throwing down jars in random positions 
that spawn enemies upon breaking. The Collector jumps into the ceiling 
and throws down 3 jars and pops back down into the arena after doing so. 
The jars do not break upon hit ting The Knight but instead, once it lands 
on the ground and breaks, enemies such as a Vengefly, Baldur or an Aspid 
Hunterwill appear. You can identify the number of jars The Collector will 
throw down and where it will come from by the following: First, yo u can 
hear a glass -like chime that sounds like The Collector rummaging through 
his possessions which indicate the number of jars he will throw down, the 
maximum number of jars it can throw is three. And second, rubble will 
come out from the ceiling which i ndicates the direction it will fall out 
from - the same goes to when The Collector will emerge from the ceiling. 
Your dash ability will come in handy in this situation. If there are no 
enemies spawned, it will drop 2 jars, if there is one enemy, it will on ly 
drop 1 jar.The Collector's GrabOne of its attacks is a grab attack which 
doesn't really grab The Knight upon reach, but rather, inflicts damage 
upon contact. The Collector first leaps in a short distance and once 
lands on The Knight's position, it will perform a grabbing motion attack. 
The Collector can perform a mix up where it can leap once and reach in 
for the grab, or leap twice until it's close enough before grabbing. It 
is recommended to avoid its leaps and bait it to perform its grab before 
striking it from a distance.Countless HopsThis is considered to more of 
The Collector's mechanic of moving around the arena and evading your 
attacks. This move is unpredictable since it hops fast like it's on a 
pogo stick for about three times in different posit ions before it 
performs an attack of either jumping into the ceiling for raining down 
jars or leaping in for a grab attack. It also makes this move dangerous 
since The Collector can hop once, twice, or thrice before it decides 
which attack it will perform. Maximum SummonFor Phase 1, The Collector can 
only reveal three enemies.Phase 2Rain of JarsIf there are no enemies in 
the arena, it will drop 3 jars. If there is one remaining, The Collector 
will throw 2 jars and if there are 2, it will only drop 1 jar.The 
Collector's GrabThe Collector will most likely mix up its attack 
depending on the situation. If there are no enemies in the arena, chances 
are high that it will jump into the ceiling to perform its jar attack to 
summon the enemies. If there are a few, chan ces are it will try to leap 
in and grab you as well as mixing it up by jumping into the ceiling. If 
it has its maximum amount of spawning enemies, it will only perform its 
hops and grab attack.Maximum SummonAs for phase 2, the maximum amount it 
can spawn e nemies is two.The Collector LoreThe Collector is found at the 
Tower of Love in the City of Tears. Neither a bug nor a plant, this 
unique and enigmatic creature made out of Void is obsessed with 
collecting bugs of Hallownest and putting them into jars. It c aims to 
love them, and its jars are meant to protect and preserve them.During the 
fight The Collector often cackles and whoops with an eerie delight, seemingly a creature gone mad. When staggered for the final time and 
about to die, it clutches its face an d drips out Void profusely. It is 
unknown where The Collector came from or why it has an obsession with 
collecting and preserving Hallownest s fauna. It is also unclear how it 
came to reside in the Tower of Love, which used to belong to the bug you 
obtain the Love Key from.The Collector is the one responsible for 
capturing Grubs and placing them in jars. It seems to believe this 
"protects" the Grubs, either from the outside world or some other 
perceived threat.The Collector Notes & TriviaDefeating the Colle ctor 
unlocks the "Obsession" Trophy/Achievement.The Collector can be 
encountered in Godhome.If The Knight dies in the middle of a battle with 
the Collector, theShadecan appropriately be found trapped inside a jar 
upon re-entering the Tower of Love.There is  a hidden area above the 
Collector's study where the Grubs and the Map are located. There is a 
strange drawing in this room depicting a Grub in its final stage of 
life.BossesBroken Vessel,Brooding Mawlek,Brothers Oro and Mato,Crystal

successfuly obtain the Collector's Map. You will need Shade Cloak, Isma's 
Tear, and Mantis Claw. Now head over to the Queen's Gardens, it is 
located on the western part of the map. It has an upper and lower 
entrance. If you want to take the upper entrance, it is advisable that 
you first acq uire the Shade Cloak so you can dash through the gate that's 
blocking the way. If you prefer the lower entrance, you'll need to 
acquire Isma's Tear, since this area is hindered by a pool of acid.After 
making your way to the Queen's Gardens, you'll need to work your way to a 
corner area located at the southeast level. This is where the Love Key is 
hidden, which will be needed to open the Tower of Love, where The 
Collector's Map is located.You'll encounter a bunch of enemies along the 
way before you reach the  Love Key. The key is also blocked by an acid 
pool, this is where you'll use Isma's Tear so you can swim through the 
pool. Once you reach the area, you can now loot the Love Key off the 
corpse.Once you've acquired the Love Key, head over to the Tower of Lo ve. 
Upon entering the area, you will be met with a closed door with a giant 
keyhole. Now open this door with the Love Key that you've just acquired. 
Enter and climb the tower. Defeat a couple of enemies you'll encounter along the way. At the end, you will meet the boss of the area, The 
Collector. To learn more tips on how to beat this boss, click here. After 
defeating The Collector, go to the next room and climb up using Mantis 
Claw. You'll find The Collector's Map there at the end of the room.The

Troupe Master Grimm.The Grimm Troupe LocationsDirtmouthHowling CliffsThe 
Grimm Troupe WalkthroughIn order to start this quest, players will need 
to summon the Grimm Troupe into town. And to do that you will need to 
make your way to Howling Cliffs(its location is indicated above).From 
there, you will find a breakable wall that c an be destroyed with The Nail 
which leads to a secret passagewhere at the end, you will find the 
exoskeleton of a large beetle -like bug wearing a peculiar cloak over its 
head. At this stage of the game, we will assume that you have already 
acquired the Dre am Nailwhich you will need to strike it at the body of 
the bug. Red lights will appear and dream gates will float in the 
background.After hitting the cloaked bug with the Dream Nail, head back 
to the previous path where you'll find a mystical furnace or br azier with 
an unlit torch that resembles a long -fingered claw. Strike the grate of 
the furnacemultiple times for the torch around the area to burst out red 
flames along with musicthat will start to play. This will summon the 
Grimm Troupe and they will set up camp in Dirtmouth.Immediately head back 
to Dirtmouth and enter the large tent with two Grimmsteeds resting in 
between the entrance to find Troupe Master Grimm, speak to him to receive 
the Grimmchildcharm and to learn about the task he will provide.After  
speaking to Grimm, open your map to find red flame pins which indicate 
the location of the multiple Grimmkin and their flames you will need to 
find and harvest (which isshown on the photo above). The first task will 
be easy since all you need to do is pro ceed to its location, defeat the 
Grimnkin Novice, absorb his flame and head back Troupe Master Grimm - 
returning to him will reward you with an upgraded Grimmchild and at the same time he will send you off again to collect three more flames.Up 
next,the sec ond task will be similar to the first, as to proceed to the 
area with the flame pins marked on the map and harvest the flames, only 
this time the Grimmkin Novices have now been replaced by Grimmkin Masters 
and their location has been pushed further into th e depths of Hallownest 
to make the quest a bit challenging - one can be found in King's Pass, 
one in Kingdom's Edge, and one in Resting Grounds.Once you've collected 
all three, head back to Dirtmouth and speak to Grimm which will trigger a 
boss battle. His  attacks consist of emitting multiple pyrokinetic fiery 
projectiles, quick dash attacks both on the ground and mid -air and 
phasing spikes up through the ground. And upon entering his second and 
third phase, his movement increases and adds more projectiles to his 
attacks - after defeating him, he will upgrade the Grimmchild to his next 
phase as well as Charm Notch. Grimm will then ask you to harvest the last 
three flames to complete the ritual.After that's done,head outside and 
check your map to find the loc ation of the last flames, where one is 
found in the Distant Village, one in the Fungal Wastesnear the Mantis 
Villageand one in the Ancient Basin. At this point, it will be more 
difficult to obtain the flames since it is now heavily guarded by 
Grimmkin Nigh tmares and are located even further compared to the first 
two tasks. As the same as before, defeat all three the Grimmkin and 
consume their flames before moving forward. Now you will have two options 
on how you would like to finish this quest. You can eith er betray Grimm 
by conspiring withBrummto banish the Grimm Troupe from the town, or you 
can continue the task and deliver the remaining flames back to the Troupe 
Master Grimm. Whichever decision you make will impact on how the story 
ends, as well as the co ntinuity of the game, and you will no longer be 
able to redo it after saving the game.Brumm and the Nightmare King 
WalkthroughIf you choose this option, you will have to head back to the 
Howling Cliffs where the torch was lit to summon the troupe to find 
Brumm. Speak to him and he will tell you about defying his master and 
wanting to cast out the troupe, proving himself to be a traitor. After 
the dialogue, he will thrust his staff on the grate of the furnace, 
causing the mechanism to break. Shortly after, y ou will gain control of 
The Knight and you will have to continue striking the grateto destroy it 
- as you continue hitting it, the flames within the torch will explode 
and the screen will turn into white. The Knight will regain consciousness 
in the same ar ea. The torch along with Brumm will disappear, implying 
that you have successfully banished the troupe.Doing this will have 
several consequences. First, the Grimmchildcharm will disappear from your 
inventory. Second, the Grimm Troupe along with anything th at is related 
to them disappears from Dirtmouth as well. Third, any fragile charm that 
is currently consumed and unrecoveredfrom Divine will be left where her 
tent had been, and you can no longer upgrade any Fragile Charms into 
Unbreakable ones. And finall y, a new NPC called Nymm(Brummin disguise), 
who has supposedly lost his memories, will appear in town and provide the 
Carefree Melodycharm upon talking to him. Choosing this path will also 
grant you with the Banishment Achievement/Trophy and close the ques t. 
Nightmare King Grimmcan stillbe fought in Godhome even after 
banishment.Troupe Master Grimm and the Grimmchild WalkthroughIn choosing 
this option, you will haveto continue with completing the task and 
providing the flames to the Troupe Master Grimm. Upo n collecting the last 
set of flames, head back to Dirtmouth and to Grimm's tent - you will 
notice that Brumm is no longer inside the tent and you can now walk further inside, where you will see Grimm upside down on the ceiling, 
sleeping in a bat -like posit ion. From here, make sure you have equipped 
the Charms you prefer and have benched, since you will be ported into the 
dream world.The boss fight with Nightmare King Grimm will initiate once 
you use the Dream Nail on Grimm. Nightmare King Grimm's attacks ar e 
similar to Troupe Master Grimm, with some additional moves, faster pace 
and more health.After defeating the Nightmare King Grimm, the screen will 
fade into white and The Knight will awaken outside with a fully evolved 
Grimmchild. Thus Master Grimm is reb orn by the flames. Troupe Master 
Grimm's tent along with the Grimmsteeds will disappear; however, Divine 
will remain in town, which will give you the chance to upgrade any 
fragile charms into unbreakable ones. Choosing this path will also grant 
you with th e Ritual Achievement/Trophy and close the quest.The Grimm 
Troupe Notes & Notable LootEvery time you return to Troupe Master Grimm, 
make sure you have the Grimmchildcharm equipped.If you head to 
Millibelle's stand while you have the Grimmchildcharm equipped , he will 
consider her an enemy and will attack her to protect the Knight from the 
con-artist, making it impossible tospeakto her.If you exit the Lantern 
room before you break the brazier, Brumm will disappear and his quest to 
banish the Grimm Troupe will disappear forever.If you chose to complete 
Brumm's quest, any unbreakable charms that you haven't acquired yet will 
not be obtainable anymore.If Divine has a Charm that is currently 
consumed once you've banished the Grimm Troupe, you will see it will be 
left on the ground in its fragile form when you return to

 The Knight   The Knight in Hollow Knight is the protagonist of the 
game.The Knight General InformationThe Knight is a Vessel, a mystical 
insectoid beingcreated by the higher beings The Pale King and The White 
Lady. They are ma de of Void and were born in The Abyss, a limbo -like 
place deep beneath Hallownest. The Pale King created many other vessels, 
one of which was theHollow Knight. It was taken to the White Palace while 
the other vessels, including the Knight, were discarded a nd left in the 
Abyss.The Abyss was then sealed up, but somehow (it's never explained in 
the game) the Knight and a number of their Vessel siblings escaped. For a 
while they wandered the world, oblivious to their heritage and purpose. 
Some time later, the K night was called back to Hall ownest by the Hollow 
Knight, now sealed in the Temple of the Black Egg.In the City of 
Tears,Hornet metaphorically mentions tothe Knight that they were born 
from two voids , one being the Void of the Abyss and the other an 
unknown region outside of Hallownest where they spent their youth. The 
time spent away from Hallownest caused them to forget the circumstances 
surrounding their birth and escape, but granted them great strength and 
resilience. After she is defeated the second time at Kingdom's Edge, 
Hornet will grudgingly encourage the Knight to acquire theKing's Brand 
from the Cast -Off Shell, which she states will allow them to claim 
themself as King of Hallownest. The King's Brand also lets them enter 
the Abyss, which Hornet  hopes will influence their decision to 
"perpetuate Hallownest".Once the Knight obtains Void Heart and restores 
their memories, they gain the power to unify the Void under their own 
will. This causes Hornet to ally with them in the final battle.The Knight 
starts off with an Old Nail as their sole weapon and the ability to heal 
themself with the use ofSOUL. The Knight will be given access to new 
spells, powers, abilities, items, and upgrades as they progress through 
their bizarre journey.The Knight Health an d SoulHealth MaskThe Health of 
the Knight is represented by a number of masks in the upper -left corner 
of the screen. he Knight starts off with 5 masks. More can be obtained by 
finding Mask Shards. You will need 4 Mask Shards to create 1 newHealth 
Mask, up  to a maximum of 9 Health Masks. The Knight loses health when 
they run into enemies, are attacked, or touch an environmental hazard. 
Health can be regained by resting at a Bench or by using Focus.Soul 
VesselSoul Vessels are additional storage for SOUL. The y are represented 
by small circles beside the main SOUL meter. You need 3 Vessel Fragments 
to craft 1 new Soul Vessel, up to a maximum of 3. Soul Vessels 
automatically transfer SOUL to the main meter when it has free 
space.Lifeblood MaskLifeblood Masks are  blue masks added on top of the 
base health. They cannot be healed with Focus. They are granted 
byLifeseed or specific Charms. Lifeblood Masks gained from seeds will 
disappear once you rest at a bench, while Lifeblood Masks granted by 
Charms will regenerat e on resting.SOULSOUL is represented by the circular 
meter next to the Health Masks. SOUL is used by The Knight to cast Spells 
such as Focus. SOUL is primarily gained by hitting enemies with the Nail. 
It can also be gained from Soul Totems or by using cert ain charms, e.g. 
Grubsong.The Knight's Equipment and AbilitiesNailThe Nail is The Knight's main weapon. It can be swung in four directions to hit enemies, walls or 
certain objects. It is The Knight's main tool for facing the dangers 
ofHallownest. As you pr ogress throughout the game, you can choose to 
upgrade The Nail with Pale Ore and learnNail ArtsfromNailmastersto unlock 
new moves.Hitting anything with the Nail generates knockback. This 
mechanic can be used to traverse areas with spikes or to gain height from 
breakable objects. This is known as pogoing.CharmsCharms are special 
items that can be acquired by completing quests, searching areas, or 
purchasing them from Merchants. Charms provide enhancements to The 
Knight's existing powers as well as adding new  ones - including increased 
health, reduction of healing times, higher Nail damage and many 
more.SpellsSpells are skills that use SOUL. They have a variety of 
purposes like dealing damage, opening up new areas and dialogue and more. 
The starting spell is F ocus, which replenishes The Knight's health. New 
spells can be found in various areas throughoutHallownest. There are 4 
spells available in total. 3 of them can be upgraded into Void versions: 
for example, a Vengeful Spirit spell can be upgraded into Shade  
Soul.Spells are largely connected to Snail Shamans, one of whom you will 
encounter early in the game. Offensive spells tend to deal higher damage 
than the Nail, but they must be used sparingly as they drain your healing 
resource.AbilitiesAbilities are ski lls that do not require SOUL. This 
includes Mothwing Cloak, Monarch Wings, and more. Abilities provide you 
with new ways of traversing Hallownest and engaging in combat. There are 
6 abilities available in total. Every time you gain an ability, it is 
automatically equipped and ready for use. Unlike with charms, you do not 
need to choose between abilities in your inventory - you can use any and 
all of them.Note that some areas can only be accessed once you have a 
certain ability. If you encounter a ledge or a n item that's out of reach, 
don't worry; you can always come back later.The Knight Gallery

 The Pale King   LocationOnly appears as a memory.The Pale King is an 
NPCin Hollow Knight. The Pale Kingwas the king of Hallownest and also the 
White Palace and is a mate to The White Lady.The Pale King InformationThe 
Pale King, previously referred to as a Wyrm, reduced his form to the size 
and appearance of most of the bugs in Hallownest. Some lore tablets 
indicate that, after he transformed, he granted the bugs in Hallownest 
sapience, insight and knowledge in order for th em to follow him towards 
the rise of Hallownest. However, artifacts such as Arcane eggs suggest 
that other sapient civilizations existed long before Hallownest.The Pale 
King was rarely seen outside of his palace, but he had innumerable 
devotees and followe rs who strongly believed that The Pale King created 
the world they live in. His worshippers grew in numbers, gaining followers such as the moth tribe and the mushrooms living at the Fungal 
Wastes, who glorified him.When the Moth tribe joined Hallownest, it  
angered The Radiance, goddess of light and dreams. The Radiance began to 
appear in the dreams of Hallownest's inhabitants in order to force them 
to recall it and worship it again. This manifested as The Infection. The 
Pale King countered The Infection by sealing it in a Vessel, a hollow 
being created by him andThe White Lady using Void. He also tasked three 
bugs to become the guardians (known as the Dreamers) and contain the 
Hollow Knight and The Radiance.Eventually, the Hollow Knight could no 
longer conta in The Infection. Foreseeing this, The Pale King created 
dozens upon dozens of new Vessels, all of whom he intended to sacrifice 
in order to keep Hallownest standing.The Infection started to leak and 
spread out, infecting the minds and bodies of the bugs o f Hallownest. The 
White Palace disappeared along with its ruler. TheGodseeker claims that 
The Pale King'sexistence has been wiped out of history and that the cause 
of his death is still unclear.Location: The Pale King Can be found as a 
memory at the White Palace, Path of Pain, and The Abyss.Progression: The 
Pale King's body can be found in his throne room, still seated upon his 
throne.Combat: Players may not kill The Pale King.Associated 
QuestsN/ADialogueNo cost too great.No mind to think.No will to break.N o

light that plagues their dreams.You are the Vessel.You are the Hollow

created in Hallownest, including the Stagway s and Tram that was built for 
traveling within the kingdom.Upon encountering his corpse in the memory 
of The White Palace, players can strike him with a nail until he falls to 
the floor, granting the White Fragment. Before you pick up the item, you 
may sit on the emptied throne.NPCsBardoon,Bretta,Brumm,Charm Lover

More EndingThe Radiance StrategiesStrategy WriteupFor this boss, you'll 
want to upgrade your Nail to its maximum level as well as obtaining the 
empowered versions of your Spells and Abilities. Shade Cloak is your best 
friend in this batt le as you will be dashing through The Radiance's 
attacks. Abyss Shriekis also recommended here in order to deal maximum 
damage since The Radiance often positions itself above The Knight.Charms: 
havingQuick FocusandQuick Slashequipped for this battle will b e useful in 
order to perform your actions at a quicker rate. Pairing it with Grubsong 
will also help you gain SOUL. Having Shaman Stonepaired with Spell 
Twistercan help you increase the overall effectiveness of your Spells.The 
Radiance has 5 Phases. Its fi rst phase will consist of its common 
attacks. Phase 2 starts once it starts spawning spikes on the floor 
randomly.Phase 3 is the most difficult. The Radiance will execute all of 
its attacks in rapid succession, forcing you to focus on not getting hit 
- this is where the usage of Abyss Shriekor any spells will come in 
handy.For Phase 4, you'll be fighting The Radiance on small separated 
platforms, so ranged spells may come in handy.Its last phase will consist 
of it shooting a beam of light as you climb the p latforms. You'll need to 
reach the top and to strike it with a single blow using The Nail.Attacks 
& CountersAttackCounterPhase 1Circular SwordsWatch for the swords as they 
appear around the Radiance and positionyourself in the gap between their 
trajectorie s to avoid getting hit.Pillar of LightWith the help of 
Mothwing Cloakor Shade Cloak, dash through thepillar to avoid it. You can 
also use Descending Dark to i -frame through it.Horizontal SwordsDash 
through the swords or watch their positioning and use the gaps in between 
to jump through.Orb of LightThe best way to avoid it is to try to bait it 
to land on the surface and disperse.Phase 2Spiked FloorsLook at the floor 
and stand where it is clear of the spikes. Lights will start to flash on 
the floor to identi fy where the spikes will emerge.Burstof LightWatch the 
beams. It will first release thin rays of light to identify where it will 
be hitting. Try to position yourself between them before they grow into 
larger beams.Vertical SwordsLook at the ceiling to see the positioning of 
the swords. As it falls down, use the gaps to avoid getting hit.Phase 
3Endless BarrageFocus on dodging its attacks striking from range. The 
Radiance will continuously spawn spikes on the ground and call forth 
horizontal and vertical swor ds. Use Abyss Shriekor Spells to inflict 
damage.Phase 4The Radiance uses all of its attacks except the spiked 
floor and vertical swords. The platforms will be smaller, making it 
difficult to maneuver around the arena.Phase 5Beam of LightSimilar to the 
burst of light attack. Watch out for the first thin beam to identify its 
position and avoid it before it expands into a larger beam.The Radiance 
LoreThe Radiance is a higher being of light and the former leader of the 
Moth Tribe. It was worshipped by the bugs of Hallownest before the 
kingdom itself was created. Then The Pale King arrived to found 
Hallownest, claiming to grant a higher intellect and free will to anyone 
who accepted his rule. Through his persuasion and through conquest, the 
tribes of Hallownest e ventually followed him, forgetting The Radiance.As 
the following of the Pale King grew, The Radiance was forgotten. Furious 
with its former subjects, it began to appear in their dreams, which 
manifested as The Infection. Those who were afflicted became fre nzied.The 
Pale King created a plan to stop The Infection by sealing it inside a 
Vessel infused with the Void. This was the Hollow Knight. After its 
creation in the Abyss, the Hollow Knight was then raised and trained in theWhite Palace and grew into a matu re Vessel. Eventually it sealed The 
Radiance within itself and was locked in the Temple of the Black Egg. 
Many more Vessels were abandoned in the Void as they were deemed not 
strong enough, while others escaped, unaware of the sacrifice they were 
meant to perform.Over the years The Radiance was able to influence the 
Hollow Knight, making it a source of The Infection. Its shell broke open, 
allowing the Radiance s energy to seep out and overtake Hallownest once 
more. This led to the decline of Hallownest and the disappearance of its 
rulers.The Radiance Notes & TriviaUnlocks the "Dream No

 Traitor Lord LocationQueen's GardensHealth800RewardGain access to The 
White LadyTraitor Lord is a Boss in Hollow Knight. Bosses are special 
Enemiesthat feature their own arena, a large amount of health, and a 
variety of unique moves and abilities.You will  need to perform multiple 
attacks such as using The Nail and Nail Arts along with theSpells and 
Abilitiesin order to defeat them. Some bosses are capable of entering 
into a state of stagger after landing a number of attacks on them.As soon 
as you encounter  a boss,its name will appear on the screen, the music 
will change into a boss battle theme, and usually, pathsconnecting the 
arena will close or will be blocked leaving you no choice but to face 
these devastating and unique foes.Deposed Lord of the Mantis tribe. 
Embraced the infection and turned against his sisters.I have felt that 
desire. The desire to take the infection into myself. To become stronger, 
more powerful... these thoughts haunt my dreams during the darkest times. 
A false hope, but it can burn so brilliantly in one's mind.Traitor Lord 
LocationQueen's GardensTraitor Lord RewardsGain access to The White 
LadyTraitor Lord StrategiesStrategy WriteupTraitor Lord is quite a fast 
boss, so having the right Charms, Spells and Abilitiesis needed in order 
to win this battle. First, Mothwing Cloak or Shade Cloak - this ability 
will be your savior, almost 3 out of 4 attacks can be easily dodged with 
the use of the said ability. Now, let's talk about the right Charmsto 
bring into this fight. Since you will be fr equently using your dash 
ability, having the Sharp Shadowcharm is a must, if chances are youget 
close enough or get caught up in a sticky situation, and if you dash and 
phase through Traitor Lord's attacks and himself, you can instantly deal 
damage while d ashing through him and evading at the same time.Quick 
Slash, it is quite easy to close in the gap between yourself and Traitor 
Lord, so landing quick attacks can be beneficial here since Traitor 
Lord's attacks mostly have a window of opportunity to strike. You can also 
be a trickster and have Shape of Unnequipped, this will allow you to 
easily evade the dancing scythe attack because of the size of The 
Knight's transformation will be too small for the scythes to reach The 
Knight - pairing Quick Focuswith this  charm will allow you to gain an 
increase movement speed while in the snail -like form making it difficult 
for Traitor Lord to land most of its attacks.Another strategy for cases where you need to recover health, be sure to have Quick Focusto cast 
FOCUS as fast as you can and take your time and wait for the opportunity 
to be available to heal. The best time to recover your health is when 
Traitor Lord uses his projectile attacks since whenever he telegraphs 
these attacks and you are able to dodge them quickly , you can use that 
brief moment to heal before Traitor Lord shifts to another attack.Attacks 
& CountersAttackCounterPhase 1Dash AttackTraitor Lord will dash towards 
The Knight and swing its claws forward, this attack is about mid -range 
and can easily be do dged if you jump over him or if you run/dash away - 
you can also use your Mothwing Cloak or Shade Cloak ability to phase 
through his attacks and follow up with striking the Traitor Lord with The 
Nail.Dive AttackThis attack will have the Traitor Lord jump u p into the 
air and dive down towards The Knight in a 45 degrees angle. This attack 
could cover most of the arena when he dives down and he can also perform 
it twice, if you try to perform a downward slash attack and pogo on top 
of him, this will trigger hi m to perform a dive attack. Other than that 
he can also shift into this attack as he pleases Simply use your dash 
ability to be able to evade the attack. Do not jump once he dives since 
you can get caught up in his attack.Dancing ScythesTraitor Lord will 
throw out two orange -colored scythes that move in a wave -like motion 
towards The Knight. To avoid this attack, once Traitor Lord throws out 
the Scythes, try to keep your distance and wait for it to separate from 
each other where you can use the gap in betwe en to dash in and avoid it. 
If you do this, you can dash in the middle of the gap of the scythes then 
dash towards Traitor Lord to follow up with a few strikes.Pounding 
ShockwavesFor this attack, Traitor Lord will pound the ground in place 
causing it to em it shockwaves that will run in both left and right. The 
Shockwaves are high enough that it covers the arena while it moves, so 
the best way to counter this is to use your Mothwing Cloak or Shade 
Cloakability and phase through the waves and close in the gap  to follow -
up with landing a few attacks. Use this as an opportunity to attack 
Traitor Lord since he will stay in place for a brief moment.Traitor Lord 
LoreThe Traitor Lord was one of the leaders of the Mantis Tribe alongside 
his three siblings.Once The In fection spread out, he and his followers 
chose to embrace it in order to gain more power, which led his siblings 
to cast him and his followers out of the Mantis Village.He and his 
followers decided to take refuge at the Queen's Gardensand tried to 
driveThe  White Lady away, but were temporarily held back by her rotector 
Dryya, one of The Pale King's five knights. However, Dryya was eventually 
killed. Now, his many followers along with himself remain within the 
gardens overrun by the Infection, and will destr oy anyone or anything who 
enters their domain.While exploring the Queen's Gardens, players can 
learn that at some point Traitor Lord had a child, as we can find her 
grave there, mentioned also by Grey Mourner. Very little is known of her 
except that she wa s the Mourner's lover and that they couldn't be 
together due to the Lord's rebellion. It is unknown how she died or who 
buried her there (since the epitaph reads "here lies the Traitor's 
child", it would seem someone from Hallownest authorized the burial, as 
it is unlikely that the mantises in Queen's Gardens would call their 
patriarch a traitor).Traitor Lord Notes & TriviaDefeating the Traitor

MimicShielded FoolBattle ObbleOblobbleFullTrial of the 
ConquerorWalkthroughEnlist in the TrialsNow this second trial is a bit 
more challenging than the last one, and as all trials go within the 
Colosseum, you would first need to enlist your self. Go to the banner in 
the middle and enlist in the trial, you would have to pay 450 Geo for the 
entry fee, then head right to enter the arena.Fight your way through 
waves of enemiesTo beat this trial, you would need to fight your way 
through 16 waves o f enemies before battlingthe final boss, Oblobble.For 
the first wave, you will first be facing off against a Heavy Fool. This 
enemy will charge towards you and jump to counter your air attacks. Try 
slashing while jumping over when you see it charging towar ds you. Upon 
defeating the Heavy Fool, two Winged Foolswill spawn. They will also 
constantly charge towards you and try to slash you with their swords. 
Wall-jumping and nail -jumping off their heads is a good way to deal with 
them. After defeating the two, another Winged Fool and a Heavy Fool will 
spawn together.The second wave immediately starts with platforms rising 
up from the ground, then two Armoured Squits will spawn. These enemies 
aren't as tough as the others, butthey attack by charging straight 
towards you in a straight line, trying to impale you with their beaks. If 
you're facing several Armoured Squits at once, it can be a hassle. Try 
jumping over them and nail -jump when you see them charging towards you, 
or you can use spell to quickly wipe them o ut.For the third wave, spikes 
will come out of the ground along with two more Armoured Squits spawning. Deal with the Squits as you stay on the platforms. Note that these spikes 
will be staying for a few more waves.The fourth wave will start withtwo 
platformsfallingoff leaving a single elevated platform in the middle. 
You'll be facing off against a Winged Fool, followed by an Armoured Squit 
shortly after. You'll be having limited space to move during this wave, 
so try not to move around to much when you're dodging their attacks, you 
might end up falling down the spikes if you do.For thefifth wave, six 
more elevate platforms will rise. Now you'll be fighting a group of 
flying enemies. Take advantage of the platforms during this wave. An 
Armoured Squit and a P rimal Aspid will first spawn, then it will be 
followed by another Squit and Aspid shortly after. Three Volatile 
Gruzzers will also spawn, followed by two more Gruzzers afterwards. Take 
out the Squits and the Aspids first, then you can take your time to hea l 
if you need to, as the Gruzzers have slow movement, you can also use the 
platforms as some kind of shield from the blobs they drop. Take out the 
Gruzzers by nail -jumping and slashing them, make sure to avoid their 
bodies after you take them out, as they explode and deal damage upon 
contact.The sixth wave will start with most of the platforms 
disappearing, leaving you with a medium -sized platform in the middle of 
the arena. A Heavy Fool will then spawn in the middle. This would just be 
a simple fight, as y ou can just push or dodge out of its way, then it 
will fall to its death on the spikes. After taking out the Heavy Fool, 
three Belflies will spawn. These enemies will dive towards you, and then 
exploding on contact. Trying to attack them will only damage y ou and get 
you blown up, so it's best to just avoid them entirely. When you here 
their high -pitch cry, that's your cue as to when they will be diving 
towards you. Having the Monarch Wings will save you here, as you can jump 
out the platform as they dive, t hen jump back again to the platform after 
the explosion.There isn't really that much for the seventh wave, as two 
platforms will just disappear, leaving one in the middle. Then a single 
Belfly will spawn, and that's about it for this wave. You can just avo id 
its attack then you can quickly move on to the next wave.The spikes will 
disappear along with the platform for the eighth wave. You'll be dealing 
with Hoppers this time, as their names suggest, they will hop around the 
arena and land on your head, there  will be eight of them spawning, but 
they can be easily taken down so it shouldn't be a problem. Once you've 
defeated 8 of the Hoppers, a Great Hopper will spawn. This one is larger 
than a regular Hopper and will follow you around the arena until it's 
able to squish you. Still, this isn't much of a tough opponent, just 
dodge its attacks and strike it when you have the chance once it lands 
and they should be taken out easily.The ninth wave will start with the 
walls closing in on you, then a Great Hopper will  spawn. The enclosed 
walls will now make it difficult for you to dodge the Great Hopper's 
attacks. You can try to wall -jump off the walls then land on the Great 
Hopper's head and nail -jump until you defeat it.For the tenth wave, the 
walls will now revert b ack to its original state, but then the ceiling 
drops down. A glass jar with a Grub inside will then appear. Shatter the 
jar and a Grub Mimic will come out, defeat it by jumping over their heads 
and nail -jump until they die.The eleventh wave will start wit h the 
ceiling rising back up, and a single platform will appear in the middle. 
You'll be fighting another group of enemies for this wave. First, two 
Shielded Fools will spawn, followed by two Winged Fools, then a single 
Heavy Fool, and finally, two Armoure d Squits. The platform will start to 
lower itself after you've finished dealing with the first batch of enemies. Prioritize in taking out the flying enemies first, as they will 
tend to get in the way and make it difficult for you when you're dealing 
with the rest of the enemies.The walls will start closing in again for 
the twelfth wave. A Heavy Fool will first appear, then will be followed 
by a Winged Fool afterwards. You can quickly defeat them by wall -jumping 
then nail -jumping on their heads.For the thirt eenth wave, spikes will 
reappear on the ground, but there will be no platforms for you to stand 
on. The only way for you to avoid the spikes is by constantly wall -
jumping off of the enclosed walls. Flying enemies will then start to 
spawn, first off is an A rmoured Squit, then a Winged Fool, and then 
folowed by two more Armoured Squits. You will need to keep wall -jumping 
to try and avoid the spikes while trying to take down the enemies in the 
air. Monarch Wings and Shade Cloak will prove useful for this wave,  as it 
wil allow you to double jump and dodge through some of the enemies.For 
the fourteenth wave, the walls wil revert back to its original state, 
then three platforms will appear. Now you'll be fighting a pair of Winged 
Fools, followed by a single Winged  Fool, then two Armoured Squits 
afterwards.The fifteenth wave will start with thespikes temporarily going 
away, and now you'll have four platforms to move across from the arena. 
This will be the wave where you'll encounter the enemy Battle Obbles. 
This typ e of enmy flies around while simultaneously shoting projectiles 
in an X shaped arrangement. This will make it easy for you to dodge if 
you directly beneath, above, or beside them. More Battle Obbles will 
spawnconstantly after killing one after the other an d about halfway 
through this wave, the spikes will begin to reappear and more platforms 
will return. You'll have to defeat a total of 9 Battle Obbles to continue 
to the next wave.For the sixteenth wave, the spikes and platforms will 
lower,the ceiling will also drop down. Four Battle Obbles will spawn, 
this can be a bit difficult since you'll have less space for you to move 
around. Try to get beneath them and slash upwards or try to jump over 
them then nail -jump over their heads to get your attacks in.For th e final 
challenge of this trial,it'll start off with the ceiling going back to 
its original state. Then you'l be facing off against two Oblobbles, these 
are much larger than your average Obble, andthey will shoot out 
projectiles in all directions, making i t hard to dodge. Try focusing on 
one of them at a time. When you defeat one of them, the other becomes 
enraged and starts shooting projectiles a lot faster. Keep dodging and 
slashing, also try using spells, it could be a life saver. Completing 
this trial w ill grant you access to enlist inthe last trial and you'll be 
awarded with 1800 Geo, 1x Pale Ore, and the Conqueror Achievement/Trophy. 
Replaying this trial will reward you with2,000 Geo for each 
completion.Video[video goes here]Map[map goes here]Trivia & Notes: Trivia

within the Colosseum, and it's also the hardest. Now go towards the last 
banner and enlist in the trial. You would need to pay 800 Geo for the 
entry fee, then head right to enter the arena.Fi ght your way through 
waves of enemiesThe first wave will start off with you already facing off 
against a group of enemies. A Heavy Fool and a Shielded Fool will first 
spawn, followed by two Armoured Squits. Two Shielded Fools and a Primal 
Aspidwill spawn n ext, followed by two Winged Fools and two Sharp 
Baldursafterwards. Prioritize the flying enemies first before dealing 
with the ones on the ground. Also try to create some distance between 
enemies whenever you need to heal.The second wave will start with 
platforms rising up, two Sturdy Fools and a Primal Aspid will then spawn. 
Just focus on the Primal Aspid, the spikes on the ground will eventually 
come out during this wave and it'll take care of the Sturdy Fools on the 
ground.The ceiling will start to drop down for the third wave, then three 
Battle Obbles and a Winged Fool will spawn. First take out the Winged 
Fool and try to stay away from the Battle Obbles' projectiles. After 
defeating them, two Furious Vengflies will spawn. Try taking them out one 
at a time and make sure to keep away from their exploding corpses once 
you're done.The fourth wave will start with the spikes and platforms 
disappearing from the arena, then two Heavy Fools will spawn. Do not try 
to attack yet, as six Belflies will spawn after sh ortly and start diving 
in. Just try to cling to the wall and watch the Belflies explode and kill 
the Heavy Fools with them.For the fifth wave, the ceiling will now revert 
back to its original state. Three Death Loodles will then spawn. This 
type of enemy t ends to jump around the room, then it'll start leaping at 
you from the wall. Try to kill them quickly just as they start spawning 
so they won't be able to surround you.Four platforms will appear and rise 
up for the sixth wave, and you'll be facing off agai nstfive Death Loodles 
this time. With the same strategy, try to take them out as soon as they 
start spawning to continue tot the next wave.For theseventh wave, the 
platforms will disappear, and it will be the same as the previous wave, 
but only three Death  Loodles will spawn. Kill them as soon as they appear 
to quickly finish this wave.The eighth wave will begin with four 
platforms rising and stack up, and spikes will also appear from the 
ground. You'll be fighting several flying enemies and each time you t ake 
one out, another will immediately spawn afterwards. First will be two 
Armoured Squits, then two Primal Aspids, then followed by a Winged Fool. 
Try to keepmoving around as you dodge their attacks, as it is not a good 
idea to stay in between the platform s because you might get trapped with 
their attacks. After taking out the flying enemies, four Garpedeswill 
spawn taking up the space between each of the platforms. This type of 
enemy are invulnerable to any attacks and cannot be killed, they're just 
really considered as an environmental hazard, so all you have to do is 
avoid them. Once you've gotten past one of them, a platform should be 
safe for you to stand on, take this advantage to heal when you need to. After defeating the rest of them, a Winged Fool a nd two Armoured Squits 
will spawn. Defeat them to continue with to the next wave.The arena will 
now revert back to its original state for the ninth wave. You'll be 
fighting a lot of enemies during this wave. It'll start off with a 
Shielded Fool, Heavy Fool , and a Primal Aspid. Killing one of them will 
immediately spawn another enemy. you'll then have to fight a Mantis 
Traitor, this type of enemy is fast and can adapt to your movements.Its 
basic attack is a lunging slash attack that has a long -range. Second,  it 
performs a jump attack, where it briefly hops and is immediately followed 
up with a downward slash towards you. And last, an upward slash attack 
where ifyoutry to jump above it, it immediately attacks upward. Next up 
is a Mantis Petra, it will fire a s pinning blade, then the spinning blade 
will come back to them, acting like a boomerang. Then you'll encounter 
two more Mantis Petras and a Mantis Traitor, followed by a Heavy Fool 
afterwards.TwoSoul Twisters will then spawn, they will teleport around 
the arena while shooting projectiles at you. After defeating them,three 
Mistakes will pop out of the ground. After dealing with the Mistakes, a 
Soul Warriorwill spawn in and try to land on your head, so keep a lookout 
above you after dealing with the Mistakes. This enemy will keep 
teleporting towards you and try to hit you with its close -range attacks, 
if you try to create some distance, it will start shooting projectiles. 
After a while, the Soul Warrior will summon a Folly, these are ghost -like 
beings that as s oon as they appear, they will follow you like a homing 
projectile and deal damage upon contact.Six platforms will appear and 
spikes will rise up to start the tenth wave. Your first enemy will be a 
Volt Twister. This type of enemy will try to avoid you by t eleporting 
from place to another, its only attack is charging bolts of lightning 
then strike to wherever you are in the arena. Just try to attack it when 
it starts charging up for an attack, since it is when they're vulnerable. 
After defeating that, a Soul  Twister will spawn. This type of enemy is 
almost similar to the Volt Twister, as it tries to teleport to evade any 
attacks you try to land on them, but this one summons orbs that either 
surrounds them or use it as a projectile to shoot you. After that, tw o 
more Volt Twisters and a Soul Twister will spawn. Defeat them to advance 
to the next wave.The arena will now revert back to its original state for 
the eleventh wave. You'll only be fighting a Soul Twister and a Soul 
Warrior. Take out the Soul Twister fir st before dealing with the Soul 
Warrior.The twelfth wave will start with the walls closing in. This will 
make it difficult for you to move around the arena. First you'll have to 
fight a Winged Fool and a Sturdy Fool. Two Lesser Mawleks will then show 
up afterwards, start swiping them with your nail as soon as they spawn 
in, as they can be difficult to deal with, considering their attacks are 
annoying. Another pair of Lesser Mawleks will spawn after defeating the 
first two, along with one Winged Fool. The la st enemy that'll spawn is a 
Brooding Mawlek, this is a bigger version of the Lesser Mawlek, and has a 
bunch of other attacks. It'll spit more blobs at you and will try to 
swipe you with its claws if you get too close. It will also jump in the 
air and try t o land you. It can also spit out multiple projectiles at 
once and can almost seem impossible to dodge. You can use your Shade 
Cloak here to dash through the projectiles and try to land an attack when 
you can.The walls will start moving in a lot closer for the thirteenth 
wave. It's almost like you have no space to move around, then a Garpede 
will start to come at you from above. The walls will start to retract a 
little to let you dodge the incoming attack. You will then have to dodge 7 more Garpedes that wil l come crashing down at you from above. After 
dodging all of them, the next wave will begin shortly after.The 
fourteenth wave may be the hardest wave in possible the hardest challenge 
within Hollow Knight. The walls will start to retract a bit and the 
spikes will rise back up. The only way for you not to fall down the 
spikes is by continuously wall -jumping off the wall and cling to it as 
long as possible, while trying to deal with the group of enemies that 
will spawn shortly after. First, you'll have to dea l with the flying 
enemies, A Winged Fool and two Armoured Squits, followed by a Primal 
Aspid and another Armoured Squit, a Mantis Petra and four Battle Obbles, 
then lastly another pair of Winged Fools. Spells will save you during 
this wave, you won't be ab le to heal since you'll be stuck clinging to 
the walls while dealing with the enemies so might as well use your soul. 
Just be precise with your jumps, dashes, and nail -jumps to avoid 
mistiming and falling down the spikes.For the fifteenth wave, the ceiling  
will lower, giving you less space to maneuver. This time you'll be facing 
off against two Armoured Squits. Dealing with them can be a bit tough at 
the moment especially with the enclosed space.The sixteenth wave will 
start with the arena reverting back to  its original state as the walls 
and ceiling recede, then platforms will appear. Now you'll be facing 14 
Death Loodles, just be on your toes and dodge their attacks, they'll 
eventually kill themselves and hit the spikes below.For the final 
wave,everything will be back to normal, no more spikes and platforms. 
You'll be facing off against a group of enemies during this wave before 
fighting the boss, God Tamer. You will encounter the group of enemies in 
this order: A Heavy Fool, a Sturdy Fool, a Mantis Traitor  and a Winged 
Fool, Mantis Petra, Shielded Fool, Soul Twister, a Shielded Fool and a 
Volt Twister, a Heavy Fool, a pair of Sharp Baldurs and two Armoured 
Squits, another Heavy Fool, Winged Fool, a Shielded Fool, and finally a 
Sturdy Fool. After defeating a ll of these enemies, you'll now face the 
final boss of this challenge, which is the God Tamer. This boss is 
represented as a warrior on top of a slug -like beast, 
itsonlyattackisjumping in the air and trying to hit you with its lance. 
The other problem is w ith its beast, while jumping in the air, the beast 
will spit out a goo of infection that remains on the ground for a few 
seconds. These blobs travel in three groups, one being close to The 
Beast, the second in the middle, and the third shooting at the fart hest 
from the two. Once it lands on the ground, it will remain for a few 
seconds that deal damage upon contact. Then it can also curl into a ball 
revealing its shell, then rolls towards you. The beast is invulnerable to 
the Nail when it is curled up. It wi ll only stop rolling if it either 
hits you or it hits a wall.Youcan bounce off its shell with a downward 
strike while it's curled up and spells can penetrate its armour that 
inflicts damage. Focus your attacks on the beast even knowing that the 
Tamer is an  easy target. Once you've killed the beast, the God Tamer 
willsimply give up, and this is how you complete the challenge. Upon 
completing the trial,you'll be awarded 2700 Geo and the Fool 
Trophy/Achievement.Youcan re -run the trial and will still be rewarde d 
with 3000 Geo for each completion.Video[video goes here]Map[map goes

in the Colosseum that will be av ailable for you once you enlist in the

Trial of the Warrior WalkthroughEnlist in the TrialsTo enlist in the 
trials, you would first need to rescue Zote the Mighty. Upon rescuing 
him, head towards the Colosseum of Fools, which is located at the 
northeast side of Kingdom's Edge. Once you reach the  Colosseum, you'll 
get to meet Little Fool, the colosseum's warden. He'll be the one to 
explain to you the rules and regulations of the upcoming trials once you 
enlist in them. You would then need to pay 100 Geo for the entry fee. 
After that, head right an d enter the arena.Fight your way through waves 
of enemiesFor the Trial of the Warrior, it will consist of a total of 11 
waves before fighting the final boss, Zote the Mighty. These trials will 
get harder as they progress and it can be difficult, so knowing  what 
comes next may be extremely helpful when it comes to fighting your way 
through these trials.The first wave is of course, the easiest. You'll 
first encounter a Shielded Fool, followed by two more afterwards. These 
are not the toughest of enemies so yo u should be able to handle them just 
fine, slash and nail -jump on them to get around their shields. After 
defeating the rest of the Shielded Fools, two Sharp Baldurs will then 
spawn. They're also pretty easy to deal with since all they do is roll 
towards t heir target.After defeating the two Sharp Baldurs, the second 
wave will begin,you'll noticefive platforms will rise up and appear 
within the arena, along with thefiveSharp Baldurs that will spawn.The 
baldurs will spawn at the same time with the platforms t hat will rise up 
from the ground, meaning they can just roll towards you from above and 
land on your head. Try to evade and watch your head and take them out one 
by one. You can try to bait one or two baldurs at a time, since the ones 
at the higher platfor ms won't move until you get close enough to 
them.Once you've cleared out the room, the platforms will disappear and 
the arena will revert back to its original state. Now the third wave will 
begin, and this time you'll be fighting some Sturdy Fools. One Stu rdy 
Fool will spawn first, followed by two more afterwards. Nail -jump attacks 
aren't the best idea for this type of enemy, since they can throw 
projectiles in an upward arc. But they're not as tough as the previous 
enemies you've encountered, so you can tr eat them like normal enemies, 
just watch out for their projectiles and slash away.After defeating the 
Sturdy Fools, the fourth wave will begin. You'll notice three platforms 
will appear and rise up. Two Primal Aspidswill spawn, this type of enemy 
is annoyi ng to deal with, since it will keep its distance by flying 
around, making it hard for you to reach it with your attacks, it will 
also keep you in check by firing three blobs of acid at the same time in 
a spread -like pattern. These make them very dangerous when they are grouped together or with other types of enemies. The tactic here is to 
try and move between the spaces where you see a gap when that start 
shooting their projectiles and try to separate them, this way, you won't 
need to dodge both of their at tacks at the same time. Then try taking 
them out one at a time. Try using the platforms to create space and 
distance between you and the Primal Aspids.Once you've finished the 
fourth wave, two more Primal Aspids will spawn, and two more platforms 
will appe ar, along with spikes rising out from the floor. These spikes 
will last for a few more waves. Now the fifth wave will begin. This is 
just like the previous wave, but you'd have to maneuver your way and keep 
jumping, dodging, and dashing while trying to tak e out the Primal Aspids. 
Try using the extra platforms provided to get around the room to avoid 
the projectiles being spat by the Primal Aspids, as well as keeping 
yourself off the ground to avoid getting hit by the spikes.For the sixth 
wave, the platforms  from the previous waves will disappear, but a wide 
platform will appear in the middle, along with two small platforms 
appearing on both sides. The spikes will still stay on the ground for 
this wave. Sturdy Fools will spawn on each platform. Try and taketh em out 
one at a time, the first two will spawn on the platforms up on both 
sides, defeat either one of them first. The next one will spawn in the 
middle, try taking that down second. Then take out the last remaining 
Sturdy Fool.After defeating them, the se venth wave will now begin. The 
previous platforms will be rearranged and you'll have three wide 
platforms stacked up vertically. Two Primal Aspids will spawn, followed 
by two Sharp Baldurs afterwards. Try taking out the Primal Aspids first, 
then proceed in  dealing with the Sharp Baldurs. Don't hang around in the 
middle of the platforms, as you might get caught in between multiple 
attacks at the same time. Try to keep yourself at the edge of whatever 
platform you're standing on so you can quickly jump and ma neuver your way 
in dodging attacks if you need to.For the eighth wave, the platforms will 
retract, leaving you with a medium -sized platform in the middle. Four 
Vengeflieswill spawn, you can easily take them out with just a single 
slash. After defeating all  four of them, a Vengefly King will spawn. It 
will charge towards you and spawn more Vengeflies. Whenever it charges 
towards you, jumpover it and try nail -jumping on its head, then perform a 
slash afterwards. Doing this a couple times should get you over w ith this 
pretty quickly.After defeating the Vengefly King, the spikes on the 
ground will finally go away, the arena will revert back to its original 
state, and the ninth wave will begin. For this wave, you'll be 
facingenemies you've faced previously, inclu ding Shielded Fools, Sturdy 
Fools, Primal Aspids, and a Sharp Baldur. Defeating an enemy will 
immediately spawn the next one, remember to take out the Primal Aspids 
first, as their projectiles can be annoying to deal with. Proceed to take 
out the rest of t he enemies to move on to the next wave.For the tenth 
wave, the ceiling will start to drop down, meaning you won't be able to 
jump over your enemies anymore. Three Sharp Baldurs will spawn one by 
one, try taking them out as soon as they come out of their ca psules to 
prevent them from attacking you at the same time from both sides. This 
wave should still be pretty easy.For the eleventh wave, the ceiling will 
rise up a bit, it will still restrict your movements but it will give you 
space to jump around and man euver the arena. This time, Volatile Gruzzers 
will spawn. These can be annoying to deal with since they drop bits of 
goo that can harm you as they move around. After killing them, they'll 
drop down on the ground, then their bodies will begin to shake and explode, dealing damage upon contact. Try to get some distance after 
killing one of them to avoid damage from the explosion. After defeating 
the Volatile Gruzzers, two Gruz Motherswill appear. This type of 
enemywill hover around the arena and start charging  towards you, they 
will occasionally slam towards the ground as well. Since your space is 
limited due to the lowered ceiling, their attacks can be hard to dodge. 
Try fighting them one at a time and avoid the ground slam attacks if 
possible.Now the final ch allenge for this trial is fighting Zote the 
Mighty. Assuming you've already saved him from Deepnest, you'll be facing 
off against him for the final challenge. This boss fight is surprisingly 
easy, as he will just run towards you as he flails his weapon, yo u can 
easily dodge this and proceed to attack him head on, no real strategy or 
tactic needed. Once you beat him the first time, he won't be appearing 
anymore if you decide to repeat the Trial of the Warrior again sometime 
soon.Completingthis trial grants y ou access to enlist in the next trial 
and rewards you with 900 Geo, 1x Charm Notch, and the Warrior 
Trophy/Achievement. Replayingthis trial will reward you with 1000 
Geo.Video[video goes here]Map[map goes here]Trivia & Notes: Trivia and

 Troupe Master Grimm   LocationDirtmouthDLCThe Grimm TroupeTroupe Master 
Grimm is both a Boss and an NPCin Hollow Knight. Troupe Master Grimm is 
also the main character for The Grimm Troupe (Que st).Upon entering his 
nightmare, you will encounter his Dream form, the Nightmare King 
Grimm.Hollow KnightGrimm LoreGrimm in Hollow Knight is the leader of the 
mysterious ghostly Grimm Troupe. The Troupe serves The Nightmare's Heart, 
a higher being that ru les over the Nightmare counterpart of the Dream 
Realm. The Trope travels to wherever their scarlet Lantern has been lit, 
gathering scarlet flames from the ruins of kingdoms long gone. The goal 
of the ritual is for the current Troupe Master Grimm to be rebo rn by 
fire, becoming theGrimmchild(whowill in time mature into Troupe Master 
Grimm once more to continue the cycle). To perform this task, the Troupe 
deploys ghostly beings of flame called the Grimmkin. Although 
intimidating and perhaps sinister -looking, t hey do not appear to be 
harming anyone as they feed on the residual energy of dead kingdoms.After 
you completeThe Grimm Troupe quest, Master Grimm will be available as a 
companion to the Knight in the form of Grimmchild.Hollow KnightGrimm 
InformationGrimm in Hollow Knight is a character that is presented as 
both an NPC and boss. Players will need the DLC The Grimm Troupe or own 
the Voidheart Edition of the game to gain access to this character.You 
can find Troupe Master Grimm at his tent in Dirtmouth after you summon 
the Grimm Troupe at the Howling Cliffs(ignite their lantern by striking 
it with the nail). Talk to Grimm to receive the Grimmchild;with it, you will be able to spot the scarlet flames on your map that you would need 
to collect. Each flame that y ou see on your map represents the location 
of a Grimmkin. Grimmkin are playful fiery spirits. They will giggle, emit 
flames, and fly around the Knight. You must defeat them in order to 
obtain the flames they bear upon their torches. Be advised that they ca n 
pass through walls and platforms, as do their projectiles.Once you've 
collected all three flames, return to Troupe Master Grimm's tent and turn 
in the three flames. Troupe Master Grimm will upgrade your Grimmchild 
charm and tell you that you must collect  more flames before the final 
act. Make sure you have Grimmchild equipped, open your map and you'll 
spot three flames again. Defeat three more Grimmkin to obtain their 
flames. After collecting each flame, head back to Troupe Master Grimm. 
This will then tr igger a boss fight, which Grimm himself describes as a 
'fiery dance'.Troupe Master Grimm is one of the quickest and most 
gracefulbosses in Hollow Knight, he has multiple attacks and mix -ups that 
can make quick work of you if you're not careful. During the battle, you 
would want to finishthe fight as fast as possible and deal constant 
damage to him. Remember that every attack counts and observe his 
telegraphed movements to time your dodges correctly and strike him when 
you see an opening.After defeating him,  you will unlock the "Grand 
Performance" Achievement/Trophy.Once you finish the battle, you can walk 
past Grimm's arena and climb the wall to discover another room. Grimm 
will be dangling from the ceiling, sound asleep. Dream Nail him to begin 
the fight wi th his dream variant, Nightmare King Grimm.Hollow KnightGrimm 
Associated QuestsYou must work equip the Grimmchild charm to collect the 
flames that are presented on the map after speaking with Troupe Master 
Grimm. The Grimmkin won't spawn without it.Brumm - Accordion player in 
the same tent as Troupe Master Grimm.Troupe Master Grimm can also be 
summoned to Godhome from the Godseeker's own ritual. He will also appear

DialogueWonderful. Wonderful! My kin arrive and the time has come.This 
searing fire... It carries well the Ritual's promise.Dance with me, my 
friend. The crowd awaits. Show them you are worthy of a starring 
role!Hollow KnightGrimm Notes & TipsTroupe Master Grimm has multiple  
attacks, many of which are predictable just in time to save your masks. 
Many attacks involve watching Troupe Master Grimm as well as being aware 
of your location on the stage to dodge their projectiles and attacks (see 
his boss page).Many charms do work w ell in this fight, but personal 
favorites include Hiveblood and Nailmaster's Glory due to the lack of 
opportunity to attack and heal yourself. If Hiveblood is a charm that you 
use, be sure to knowhow other charms, such as Joni's Blessing, works with 
Hiveblood.Troupe Master Grimm will always bow to you before the start of 
a fight. If you strike him while he bows to you, he will screech and 
begin the fight with his Pufferfish attack.When you fight Troupe Master 
Grimm at Godhome, he will instead bow toGodseeke r before the start ofa 
fight.NPCsBardoon,Bretta,Brumm,Charm Lover Salubra,Cloth,Confessor

StrategiesStrategy WriteupTroupe Master Grimm is one of the quickest boss 
and has multiple mix -ups with his attacks. Note that before the fig ht, 
the Troupe Master Grimm will bow to you, if you attack him during this 
time, he will start shrieking and proceed to follow up with the 
Flamespewer attack immediately.With this battle, you will have to rely on 
your spells and charms that increase The Kn ight's speed. First, let's 
talk about the Spells.You'll want to finish this battle as fast as you 
can, and the only way to do that is to deal with constant and frequent 
damage. This is where your Spells come in, Shade Soul or Vengeful 
Spiritwill be helpful  especially when he executes the Flamespewer attack 
and the cloaked spikes. Desolate Dive is also useful since you can use it 
to evade his Uppercut attack and deal damage at the same time. Abyss 
Shriek or Howling Wraithsis also helpful whenever the Troupe Master Grimm 
telegraphs the Flamespewer attack -if you plan on using your spells more 
often than The Nail, you must have the following charms equipped that can 
buff the overall effectiveness of your Spells - Shaman Stone to increase 
the effect of the spell s, Spell Twister to reduce the SOUL required 
whenever you cast a spell, and Soul Catcher or Soul Eater to increase the 
amount of SOUL gained from striking the enemy with The Nail.Charms - a 
goodcharm that can be brought into this battle is Quick Focus and S hape 
of Unn, this allows you to quickly regenerate health when needed and also 
reduces The Knight's hitbox from his projectile attacks. Also, assuming 
that you have already obtained Shade Cloak, equipping Sharp Shadowis wise 
in order for you to dash and al so deal damage at the same time in case 
you phase through the Troupe Master Grimm.Now let's move on to the Troupe 
Master Grimm's projectile attacks. When he starts opening his cloak, this 
means that he will start sending out three flame bats at you. These are 
shot out in quick succession. Countering this requires precise timing and 
execution by double jumping over the initial attack and then dash over 
the next two. Troupe Master Grimm will be stationary during this attack, 
giving you time to deal a solid bl ow before he starts teleporting.Another 
projectile attack that he uses is called the Flamespewer, where he leaps 
into the air and immerses himself in his cloak and turns his body into 
something similar to a blowfish, and releases fireball projectiles all 
over the arena. You will be able to see this attack coming, as you will 
notice the Troupe Master Grimm will position himself at the center of the 
arena. To counter this, quickly head over to whichever side of the arena and focus on dodging the fireballs rel eased. This also requires precise 
timing and execution. Take note that this attack will only happen if the 
Troupe master Grimm's health is reduced to 75%, 50%, or 25%, and at this 
time, he will be immune to nail damage, but spells would still work on 
him.Troupe Master Grimm will occasionally teleport to another location 
within the arena to keep you on your toes, but when he gets too close, he 
will proceed to skitter off in all fours, giving you the chance to 
deliver another punishing blow.Also keep a lookou t on the Troupe Master 
Grimm's close -quarters attack, his Dive Dash and Dash Uppercut. Dive Dash 
is where you'll see him teleport in the air and cover himself with his 
cloak, forming something that looks like a drill and will drive towards 
you. After landi ng on the ground, he will follow up with a dash attack 
that has a long reach. His Dash Uppercut is where you'll see him start 
dashing towards you and attacks with a downward sweep and then uppercuts 
into the air and disperses into a red flame that shoots d own five red 
flames in a parabolic arc. Try using the Shade Cloak during these 
attacks. It is also worth mentioning that you should also try to position 
yourself close to the Troupe Master Grimm after he explodes and turns 
into a red flame during his Dash Uppercut attack, this will help you stay 
clear of his parabolic arc flame attack. This should also buy you enough 
time to heal using Quick Focus.Cloaked Spikes is where you'll see him 
burrow his cloak into the ground and release spikes that covers the 
arena. Once you see him burrow his cloak into the ground, move in between 
the gaps before it turns into a spike and use Shade Soul or Vengeful 
Spirit to deal dama ge even from a distance.Every attack counts and it 
will be better if you consistently strike the T roupe Master Grimm to 
finish the battle easily.Attacks & CountersAttackCounterPhase 1Flame 
BatsGrimm opens his wing -cloak and sends out three Flame Bats  (red 
fireballs) at The Knight. While a bat flies out of Grimm's cloak/wings, a 
pillar of fire will al so engulf above its cloak which deals damage upon 
contact. If The Knight dashes and positions itself next to Grimm, he will 
teleport at a new location and send out the remaining bats. You can play 
around with Grimm and counter this attack by dashing in whe n he 
telegraphs the attack and dash again towards his new location after 
teleporting and quickly land a strike. If you keep closing in the gap, 
this will cause Grimm to just send out one bat and instead will change 
his attack.Dive DashGrimm will teleport i n the air and cover himself with 
his cloak -wings, morphing his body into a drill -like pointed shape, and 
dives in toward The Knight. After landing onto the ground, he follows up 
with a dash attack where he elongates his arm and part of his cloak -wings 
turn into a lance -like weapon that has a long reach. Whenever Grimm 
performs this attack, do not jump at first and try to bait him into 
diving towards the direction you want. Once he lands on the ground wait 
for him to execute his next attack then jump above h im and perform a 
downward slash or use Descending Darkto deal damage.Dash UppercutGrimm 
starts off with dashing towards The Knight and attacks with a downward 
sweep then uppercuts into the air and disperses into a burst of red 
flames that shoots down 5 red  flame balls in an arc. This can be 
countered by either dashing away or through Grimm while he is on the 
ground and following it up with Abyss Shriek.Cloaked SpikesGrimm phases 
his phantasmic cloak -wings through the ground in a ghostly manner and 
releases small twisted cloths that later morph into tall red spikes that 
cover the arena. Once Grimm telegraphs this attack, you will have the 
time to move in between the gaps before it actually turns into a spike for half a second. While you are in between the spi kes you can use Shade 
Soulor Vengeful Spiritto deal damage even from a 
distance.FlamespewerGrimm leaps and teleports into the air at the middle 
of the arena, and floats as his entire body (aside from his head and 
feet) inflates into a spheroid spiky form, filling up entirely with 
bursting flames. causing him to resemble something similar to a blowfish. 
He releases small fireballs for approximately 10 seconds. This attack 
only occurs once Grimm's health is down to 75%, 50%, 25%. and if you 
happen to attack G rimm at the start of the battle when he respectfully 
bows to you, causing him to shriek. To counter this attack, it's all 
about your ability to time your jumps. Immediately run towards the end of 
whichever side of the arena and focus on dodging the firebal ls released. 
Take note that he is immune to any attacks from The Nail, but spells will 
penetrate and deal damage while he is in hisunique blowfish -like 
form.Hollow KnightGrimm LoreMaster Grimm is the immortal, fiery, 
pyrokinetic leader of the mysterious gh ostly Grimm Troupe. He and the 
Grimmkin exist in an alternate spirit realm of spectral flames, and 
travel to wherever their Lantern has been lit, namely a dying kingdom. 
The Grimm Troupe gathers scarlet Flames, remnants from dying kingdoms 
where they are c alled to. One goal of their ritual is for the current 
Troupe Master Grimm to be reborn by fire, becoming theGrimmchild (who 
will in time mature into Troupe Master Grimm once more, and his cycle 
continues).The Grimmkin are ghostly, wispy beings of flame who  honor and 
assist Grimm loyally. Grimm and his Grimmkin are very enigmatic. Certain 
characters will regard them as sinister, although the Troupe doesn't seem 
to harm anyone during the rituals.After collecting scarlet flames and 
dancing with Master Grimm, h e will become a valuable companion to the 
Knight in his reborn Grimmchild form. Though Master Grimm challenges the 
Knight, he is respectful to them, even bowing to them before doing 
battle. Conspiring with Brumm (Grimm s mutinous accordion -playing 
assistan t) and banishing Grimm and the kin from Hallownest is considered 
betrayal, though Grimm does not retaliate if The Knight chooses to side 
with Brumm/Nymm.Hollow KnightGrimm Notes & TriviaUnlocks the "Grand 
Performance" Trophy/Achievement" after defeating Gr imm.Troupe Master 
Grimm's overall health depends on the type of Nail The Knight has.It is 
possible to "cheese" Grimm using a Shaman Stone,Spell Twister and the 
spell Abyss Shriek. Simply attack him while he's bowing to you at the 
beginning of the fight; th is will trigger his Flamespewer attack. Stand 
underneath him (sometimes it's better to stand a bit to the side so the 
fireballs don't hit you) and spam the spell for an easy win. This can NOT 
be done with Nightmare King Grimm as he has more health and does n't start 
the fight the same way.BossesBroken Vessel,Brooding Mawlek,Brothers Oro

 Vessel LocationThe AbyssVessel or Vesselsis an NPCin Hollow Knight. 
Vessels are described as mysterious hollow beings, strange life -forms 
made of Void possessing no mind, no will, and no ability to feel pain. 
They were created by the Pale Kingand the White Lady.A Vessel's purpose 
is to become a host to contain the Infection and the Radiance. In order 
to do so, a Vessel must be completely pure (devoid of any kind of 
sentience - thoughts or free will) to prevent the Radiance from 
influencing it.Vessel Lore and InformationWhen the Radiance decided to 
invade the dreams and minds of the inhabitants of Hallownest to force 
them to remember and worship it, its influence caused a type of madness 
known as the Infection. To stop the Radiance s attacks and takeover of 
Hallownest, the Pale King, with the assistance of the White Lady,decided to create beings called Vessels , empty life -forms whose sole purpose 
was to contain the Infection and the Radiance.Countless Vessels were 
created and then aband oned in their birthplace in the Abyss since they 
were deemed not strong enough to fight theRadiance. These Vessels were 
left inThe Abyss, which was theirBirthplace where they were infused with 
Void. Eventually, the Pale King was able to find a Vessel that he deemed 
to be pure enough to combat and contain the Infection and the Radiance. 
He raised the Pure Vessel, and named it the Hollow Knight. The Pale King 
and White Lady then sealed the Abyss with a seal that could only be 
broken by somebody that bore the King's Brand. Most of the abandoned 
Vessels remained in their birthplace, while a few escaped (includingThe 
Knight).Once the Hollow Knight was fully grown and showed immense 
strength, it was chained and sealed up to contain The Infection and 
Radiancewithin  the Temple of the Black Egg. But later, the Pale King 
realized that the Hollow Knight was not as pure as he had anticipated, 
but was actually tarnished by an emotional bond that had formed between 
them. The Radiance used that flaw to influence the Hollow Knight, once 
again causing the Infection to reemerge.As the kingdom fell, the Pale 
King lost all control and either fled or disappeared along with his White 
Palace. The White Lady retreated into The Queen's Gardens, where she 
remained for many years. The R adiance s vengeance caused most of the 
inhabitants of Hallownest to succumb to the Infection; some resisted, 
while many perished, becoming enraged zombified husks.With enough power 
and influence, the Radiance was able to break out of the Hollow Knight, 
cracking its shell and fully wreaking the Infection throughout the 
kingdom.Vessels in Hollow KnightThe KnightThe Knightin Hollow Knight is 
the main protagonist of the game who players control. The mysterious 
Knight was able to escape the Abyss. They wandered outside of Hallownest, 
oblivious of the purpose for which they were created.The Hollow KnightThe 
Hollow Knight, also known as the "Pure Vessel", Sealed Vessel , or 
simply "the Vessel" is the chosen vessel that was given the task to seal 
the Infection and theRadiance. As thePale King saw the Hollow Knight to 
be pure, it was raised in the kingdom and was used as seal for the 
Radiance once it was fully -grown. Eventually, the Pale King realized the 
Hollow Knight s purity had been tarnished, and the Radiance ev entually 
broke free and wreakedhavoc with the Infection, leading to the events of 
the game.The Broken VesselThe Broken Vessel, also known as the Lost Kin, 
is a fallen Vessel located in theAncient Basin. It was later reanimated 
by Lightseeds and thus Infect ed. UponThe Knight confronting it, the 
Infected Broken Vessel entered a state of frenzy, making it immensely 
strong and hostile.Greenpath VesselAnother vessel that can be found 
inGreenpath, whereThe Knightfirst encounters and fightsHornet. This 
vessel is n o longer alive, and only its shell is left, but it holds 
theMothwing Cloakwhich is handed over to The Knight upon searching 
it.Deepnest VesselsThe Vessels in Deepnest are known to have managed to 
somehow escape the Abyss and found themselves in Deepnest. T hese vessels 
were captured and their empty shells can be seen hanging up in the 
background, snared by the hostile arachnids who inhabit the deathly 
place.Vessels in the AbyssxVessels that are mainly found inThe Abyss, 
also known as the Birthplace. The Knig ht can find countless shells of the 
Vessels that have been abandoned where they were created after the place 
was sealed. However, these fallen Vessels still remain and exist there as 
Shade Siblings.Vessel Notes & TipsVessel Hollow Knight Notes, Tips, and Trivia go here.NPCsBardoon,Bretta,Brumm,Charm Lover

the starting area of t he game where players can get the feel of the 
game's basic controls and combat systems. It is also the path that leads 
to Dirtmouth.Arriving in King's PassOnce you gain control ofThe Knight, 
head left first to find a small cache of Geo. Strike it with your  nail to 
obtain it. Once that's done, head right through the path and destroy the 
gates until you reach a section that has elevated platforms - just be 
careful since you will encounter 2x Crawlidalong the way.Before going up 
the platforms, drop down and he ad right where you'll find another 
Crawlidand a small cache of Geo at the end. Destroy it to obtain Geo. 
Now, jump on the platforms and head left where you'll find a tablet that 
will glow once you approach it. Read it to learn about how to collect 
SOUL and  how to use FOCUS.Continue going left after reading it where 
you'll now encounter 1xVengefly and more elevated platforms, ignore that 
first and continue going left where you'll find a breakable door, destroy 
it and head to the top to find another cache of Geo - there will be another Vengeflyin this room. Return to the previous section after 
collecting the geo and head to the top left part until you reach a corner 
with blue flowers and a Lifeblood Egg. Destroythe egg and the blobs to 
obtain 2x Lifeblood Mask that will grant The Knighta temporary health 
boost.After collecting the lifeblood masks, go right where a Crawlidcan 
be found. After killing it, walk slowly until the floor collapses. Try 
and walk at the edge where the floor will start to collapse so that you 
can jump below a small corridor that has another cache of Geo.Acquiring 
your First CharmOnce you've collected the Geo, head to the bottom part of 
the area that has small elevated platforms above spiked floors. As soon 
as you jump on the platforms, spik ed rocks will fall down from the 
ceiling. Upon reaching the 3rd small platform, jump down and head right 
into another section where you can find a cache of Geo and a path 
consisting of a spiked pit.It may look impossible to cross the path, but 
you can cros s by jumping and performing a downward slash that will allow 
The Knight to pogo off it. Once you've crossed the path, head down to 
find another tablet for you to read. From here, you'll find a chest 
containing a charm, the Fury of the Fallen - hit the chest  to open it and 
the charm will spring out from inside.After obtaining your first charm, 
head left to drop back down the section where you encountered a Vengefly 
and elevated platform. Head back to the top, and through the spiked 
floors. Only this time, hea d to the top right until you reach a breakable 
wooden leg. Strike it to destroy the walkway.The Path to DirtmouthAfter 
you've destroyed the ceiling, head up where you'll find another tablet 
saying that you are now entering the Kingdom of Hallownest. Contin ue 
going right where you'll find a huge gate, continuously strike it with 
The Nail to destroy it. Upon entering the next area, drop down and 
continue heading right where you'll find yourself in Dirtmouth, the

Lurien the WatcherWatcher Knight StrategiesStrategy WriteupWatcher Knight 
is yet once again a fastboss who has quick reflexes, so be sure to 
observe its movements when you start the battle. In total, there are 6 
Watcher Knights that The Knight will  have to face if the battle is too 
long. If you fail to defeat the first Watcher Knight within 20+ seconds, 
a second knight will be resurrected where you will now need to face two 
Watcher Knights at once. You can get rid of one Watcher Knight so that 
you can only face 5 instead, and in order do this, right before you head 
inside the arena, you can find a breakable wall in the ceiling where you 
can cause one of the chandelier to break and fall on one shell of a 
Watcher Knight.Going back, if you successfully beat a Watcher Knight 
before 20+ seconds, two Watcher Knights will automatically be resurrected 
in battle. Now be sure you have your offensive spells ready such as Shade 
Soul or Vengeful Spirit since you will need to use this to penetrate the 
shells of the  Watcher Knight once it curls up into a ball. It may be 
invulnerable to your physical attacks, but Spells will be able to 
penetrate into its shells. In conjunction with the usage of spells, 
having the Spell TwisterandShaman Stonecharm will allow you to gai n buffs 
that can strengthen and increase the effectiveness of The Knight's 
Spells.Of course, you cannot just rely on your Spells, you will have to 
use your basic attacks. So, having the Quick Slashcharm will help The 
Knight land quick and consecutive attac ks while the Watcher Knight is in its normal state. Quick Focusis a must to have so that you can quickly 
recover health, especially in a tight situation.And last, as far as 
Abilities go, it is recommended to upgrade the Mothwing Cloak ability 
into the Shad e Cloak ability, and in conjunction with this ability, 
pairing it up with the Sharp Shadowcharm will allow you to deal damage 
and evade an attack while phasing through the boss.Attacks & 
CountersAttackCounterPhase 1Double Slash AttackWatcher Knight will sw ing 
its sword in a horizontal way then follow up with a vertical attack. This 
will also allow them to move forward slightly will executing this attack. 
It can be easily dodged by jumping over them to get behind and follow up 
with an attack.Curling Ball Att ackWatcher Knight will curl up into a ball 
like a hedgehog and will roll towards The Knight. While in this position, 
they are invulnerable to any physical attacks and will only revert back 
to normal after hitting a wall. Your best tactic is to double jump and 
pogo off the Watcher Knight if you are caught up in a tight space to 
avoid this attackBouncing Ball AttackSimilar to how it will curl up into 
a ball for a rolling attack, Watcher Knight instead bounces on the ground 
twice towards The Knight's position.  It can be tricky and unpredictable, 
so the recommended strategy is to play defensively and dash/phase through 
its attacks with the use of Mothwing Cloak or Shade Cloak. Do not waste 
your effort of trying to attack it since it is invulnerable to any 
physical attacks once it curls up into a ball.Watcher Knight LoreA 
Watcher Knights are defenders of the entrance of Watcher's Spireand 
Lurien's chambers. At some point and during The Infection, they died 
while guarding the area. Later on, The Knight faces a Watc her Knight that 
has been consumed and overtaken by infected flies.Watcher Knight Notes &

number of attack sequences, like Dung Defender he tosses Dung Balls as 
projectiles. He relies heavi ly on projectile attacks and has ver few 
short range attacks. These spawn in different patterns and he can spawn 
more than one at a time. These are usually the dung balls that he gathers 
from the ground. These also have the potential to remain in the arena  as 
they bounch around and continue to deal potential damage.When White 
Defender digs into the ground, he may emerge with a line of dung balls or 
summon a line of dirt spikes. Avoid these balls and try to get attacks in 
as he himself rolls into a ball. Wat ch as he takes a dive and wait for

Palace WalkthroughGetting into the White PalaceThe journey continues as 
players will set fo rth into the White Palace. And to do this, you'll need 
to enter the Dream World by dream nailing the corpse of a knight at the 
Palace Grounds which is located at the Ancient Basin. However, you'll 
need to acquire the Awoken Dream Nail to enter.To acquire t he Awoken 
Dream Nail, you'll have to collect 1,800 Essence from defeating Warrior 
Dreams, dream bosses variants, and by extracting a few Essence from 
Whispering Root Trees. Once you have the sufficient amount, head back to 
Seerand speak to it to upgrade th e Dream Nailinto the Awoken Dream Nail - 
upon upgrading it, you can head back to the Palace Grounds at the Ancient 
Basin and dream nail the knight with the Awoken Dream Nail which will 
respectively take you into the White Palace via the Dream World.The Whit e 
PalaceThe White Palace is a difficult area that requires precise 
platforming and patience. It has three main sections that have Benches in 
between each one, and each section has a lever that you'll have to reach 
in order to gain access into the next sect ion. Upon entering, you'll find 
a bench that you can sit on to rest, and not far from it isa liftbut the 
gates around it are locked - continue heading east from the first bench 
until you reach a mini -arena where you'll face 1x Kingsmould, you'll have 
to defeat it for the gates to re -open.After killing it, exit to the right 
side of the gate, climb up, then head left where you'll find a lever. Hit 
it then retrace your steps back to where the locked gates were. Hop onto 
the platform which will take you up to a  higher level that has spikes on 
a few platforms, simply follow the path until you reach the entrance that 
will lead you into the second section.Upon entering the second section, 
climb up the passageway where you'll hear bugs that are talking. These 
are the Royal Retainers, they are weak and can be killed with just one 
strike with The Nail. From here, you'll want to reach the top right 
corner of the section and into the next segment where you'll find the 
lever. However, It is blocked by the gates and you'll  have to continue 
heading east where you'll come across a room that has circular saw blades 
moving horizontally.Once you've made it across, you'll find yourself in 
another room that has the same circular saw blades, only this time, it is 
moving vertically.  In order to reach the top, you'll have to 
simultaneously climb up the wall, then dash towards the other end to 
avoid getting hit by the blades, just be careful when you're about midway 
to the top since you'll come across a wall that has spikes and the 
movement of the saw blades will be different. To get to the top, you'll 
have to cling onto the wall then double jump in between the blades to 
avoid getting hit - upon reaching the top, head west towards the next 
segment where you'll find more saw blades surro unding the room.Now, 
timing and precision are important to avoid getting hit by the blades and 
the spikes that you'll have to pass through. You'll have to head at the 
bottom part of the room where you'll come across a spiked area to work 
your way around to reach thewest side of the room. Upon reaching the west 
side, you should find the exit that will take you into the nextroom where 
you'll find a lever at the bottom part. You'll have to do some platforming again while heading down to avoid getting hit by the  
blades.Upon reaching the bottom, you'll encounter 2x Royal Retainerand a 
lever that unlocks the gates of the main switch for the lift. Hit the 
switch, then continue to your left where you'll find yourself back to 
where the main switch is, flip the lever t hen head back outside and head 
to the southwestern side of the room to reach the second lever to open 
the gates for the lift. You'll come across yet another platforming 
section that have circular saw blades, simply follow the path via the 
platforms until y ou reach the second main switch. Flip it then continue 
following the path that will take you back to the lift, ride it to reach 
the third section of the palace.For the third section, you'll find 
yourself in a room that has circular saw blades 
andmultipleWi ngmouldenemies. Behind a breakable wall on your left is the 
entrance to the Path of Pain - an optional and particularly hard area. 
There are fewer spots to rest here and the platforming is more brutal. 
Make sure you have any and all healing Charms equipped  before you 
proceed. The walls in the Path of Pain are laid with thorns, which you 
can NOT pogo off. You can still use saw blades and spikes for pogoing. 
See the Path of Pain page for more details.Note that beating this area 
isn't required for the true end ing. If you succeed, you will reach a 
small room where a cutscene will play, revealing some additional 
information about the story. After it ends, you will be teleported back 
to the entrance, and the Path of Pain will be sealed off 
forever.Continuing up th e main area, pogo off the Wingmoulds and climb up 
into a large room. You'll find a bench that you can use before entering 
the next portion at the top.The next portion will be a long path that 
you'll have to go through in order to reach the switch that unlo cks a 
gate. And you'll have to pass through more circular saw blades and spiked 
metals that emerge from walls, ceilings, and platforms. Simply follow the 
path to the top until you reach the throne room of The Pale King.Upon 
arriving at the throne room, you 'll find the corpse of The Pale King. Hit 
its corpse a few times until the other half of the Kingsoulcharm gets 
knocked out of the corpse. Collect the other half to form the 
Kingsoulcharm, then head back to The Abyss.The BirthplaceOnce you've 
acquired the Kingsoul charm, travel back to the bottom ofThe Abyss. But 
before heading into the bottom, make sure to equip theKingsoulcharm. Now, 
head to the west bottom part of The Abyss where you'll notice the ground 
will start to shake and then open up a path that w ill take you further 
into the abyss. You'll encounter more Siblingsas you traverse the area. 
They can be killed, but they do not give soul or Geo upon death. Beware 
of getting swarmed, as there's quite a few of them.Simply head to the 
bottom part then go e ast until you reach the end where you'll find a 
large black broken egg. Strike it with the Awoken Dream Nailto enter the 
birthplace and use the platforms to reach the top where you'll find the 
King and the Hollow Knight. A cutscene will play and the Kingso ulcharm 
will change into the Void Heartcharm.Up next is the Temple of the Black 
Egg.Video[video goes here]MapClick on the image to enlarge the map.Trivia 
& Notes:What happens if I sit on the throne at the White Palace?There is 
nothing special that happens when you sit on the Throne of the Pale 
Kingaside from being able to take a nice screenshot. Do note that once 
you collect the fragment of the Kingsoul, you will automatically be 
teleported out of the palace and while you can return, the option to sit 
on the throne will no longer be available.Hollow Knight Locations

StrategiesStrategy Writeu pXero is the first Warrior Dream boss that you 
can encounter. He is easy to deal with since he only has one attack where 
he calls forth a projectile in the form of the nail. At first, he'll call 
out 2 nails where he will shoot it out towards The Knight one  at a time. 
You can identify when he will start to telegraph the attack since he will 
release a grunting sound before the nail shoots down on you. However, 
once he reaches about 50% health, he'll call forth 2 more projectiles and 
he'll have an increase of attack speed. He'll still do the same method 
where he'll grunt before shooting out the nail allowing you to prepare to 
dodge for the projectile.Attacks & CountersAttackCounterPhase 1Projectile
