The next upgrade he can do is the Channelled Nail which requires\xa0800 and 1 Pale Ore.\n\nNow, you\'ll be left with two upgrades which are the Coiled Nail and the fully upgraded Pure Nail. The Coiled Nail requires\xa02000 and 2 Pale Ore, while the Pure Nail requires\xa04000 and 3 Pale Ore. Once you\'ve successfully forged The Pure Nail, the Nailsmith will step outside.\n\nHead outside the hut where you\'ll find the Nailsmith contemplating about his existence while standing\xa0by the edge of the cliff. When you speak to him, he will mention that his work has come to an end and only wishes to see how the ultimate weapon works with his very own eyes and begs you to "cut him down" by using the nail - you are now left with the decision to spare his life and leave or to grant his request and kill him. If you choose to kill him, he will fall off the cliff and his body will be found floating in the Junk Pit,\xa0granting players with the\xa0Purity Trophy/Achievement.\n\nIf you choose to let him live, he can be found at Nailmaster Sheo\'s in Greenpath\xa0modeling for Sheo and creating wooden figures together, this grants the players with the Happy Couple Trophy/Achievement after speaking to both of them - however, in order for the Nailsmith to appear at Sheo\'s, The Knight must have acquired the Great Slash Nail Art. If the Nailsmith doesn\'t appear at Sheo\'s, acquire the Nail Art first, rest at a bench and head back to Sheo\'s hut to find the Nailsmith along with the Nailmaster. This marks the completion of the quest.\n\xa0\nA Nailsmith\'s Obsession Notes & Notable Loot\n\n??\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\nQuests\n\n\nBretta (Quest)\xa0\xa0♦\xa0\xa0Delicate Flower (Quest)\xa0\xa0♦\xa0\xa0Dream No More\xa0\xa0♦\xa0\xa0Grubfather\'s Lament\xa0\xa0♦\xa0\xa0Millibelle (Quest)\xa0\xa0♦\xa0\xa0Nailsage\'s Pride\xa0\xa0♦\xa0\xa0Secret of the Stagways\xa0\xa0♦\xa0\xa0The Grimm Troupe (Quest)\n\n\n\n\n'
